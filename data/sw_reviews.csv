0,"✅ Trip Verified |   Round trip to DCA for a wedding. Both outbound and inbound flights were on 737-700. Outbound flight to DCA was uneventful. Smooth flight all the way to DCA. ICE worked flawlessly. There was plenty of legroom in Row 1. The only negative was the bathroom could have been cleaner. Inbound flight to DAL was delayed by about 25 minutes. The window seat in Row 1 is very uncomfortable. ICE worked fine on this leg too. Bathrooms were cleaner. On both outbound/inbound flights. On both flights, flight crew provided friendly, efficient no-frills service."
1,"Not Verified |   I purchased airfare for my family traveling with small children. I purchased early bird seating so that they would be able to sit together. I have since found out that there are boarding procedures which allow families to sit together. No early bird needed. It doesn't say this anywhere on the website. I asked that the early bird purchase be refunded. Nope, sorry, we don't do that. I am an a-list member and usually fly Southwest. Not anymore. I'm going for Delta."
2,"✅ Trip Verified |  Will never fly Southwest again after today. Awful! The people are rude. My dog was in her carrier the whole flight, when I got off the plane someone was waiting to talk to me. They accused me of having the dog out of the kennel the entire flight. I had a blanket on my lap and apparently thought it was the dog. Not one of the flight attendants came up to me and said anything about the dog during the flight. Accusing me and threatening me that they are going to have to file a report and I will not be able to fly a dog again. Sounds good to me because I will never choose Southwest for my travels need again."
3,✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and my 3 children traveled from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. The staff is very disorganized in Atlanta. I almost missed my flight because of them. We were going from Atlanta-Fort. Lauderdale-La Havana. Cuba. Nov 13. From Fort Lauderdale-La Havana. Cuba the attention was excellent including the aircraft staff
4,"Not Verified |  Never again! Don't fly Southwest out of Charlotte. No kiosks, you stand in line for an hour to get a boarding pass. 2 agents checking people in, which is absurd. I paid extra to board in A group, only to get on the plane to find people savings seats for others that didn't pay. No enforcement of that not being allowed.  Southwest sucks now."
5,"✅ Trip Verified |  Wife has panic disorder and was forced to sit apart due to the terrible first come seats Southwest Airlines does. I am flying on military orders and cannot upgrade. Every other airline allows me to use my DOD ID to board, but the staff taking boarding passes denied us and all wives. Worst customer service ever! I will never fly Southwest Airlines again no matter the cost."
6,"Not Verified |  We have always flown Southwest and love it, my only complaint is the luggage department. Every time we fly into New Orleans, we always have to wait 15-30 minutes for our luggage to come out. When we flew in yesterday into New Orleans, we waited 25 minutes for our luggage to come out but on a totally different carousel that it listed on the board. Someone is not doing their job, and I will not hesitate to switch airlines on future trips."
7,"Not Verified |   Absolutely horrible experience. After being delayed for 3 hours, the pilots said “sorry folks, we just don’t know why!” They separate families even who book together so my husband and I waited in line only for the gate agent to make me go alll the way to end of line because they grouped us separately…. Then I get on and the seats are unassigned so there is no luggage space in the right areas and my husband got yelled at multiple times for saving a seat - people from the back were coming from the front so a bunch of people had to basically sit in peoples laps for the back people who had no seats left to get by. Absolutely horrible experience and so unorganized."
8,"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest used to be the best value in the skies. Additionally, they had the friendliest employees. Neither of which is true anymore. I made A-Preferred and have 950,000+ miles, so it's not that I haven't given them a fair shot. The attendants who used to be warm and friendly, and make the standard safety messages amusing, have transformed into a surly bunch, who spend most of the flight on their phones I know it's a tough job and the number of crazies have gone way up, but when your plane staff is worse than United (and can't hold a candle to Delta) it says something."
9,"Not Verified |  We have been flying with Southwest for years, and are always pleased. The in flight service is excellent, the snacks are better than most airlines, seats are comfortable, and our flights have always been on time."
10,"Not Verified |  I flew a few times in the past and I was very happy till 2 days ago. From LAX to Oakland and it was just fine. Flying from OAK to Bellingham, we were assigned to term, 31. Kept on waiting for an hour. Noticed nobody showed up. I asked told me it was moved to term 25 which was quite a long walk. When we arrived ended up at the end of the line. They changed the plane and did not bother to inform us. The plane old with a very uncomfortable seat. E ded up near restroom. Open seating was a bad idea. I will not fly Southwest again."
11,✅ Trip Verified | Horrible. 3 hr delay. Arrived at 2 am TPA. No meal vouchers. Tracked this plane all day #1842 SWA. Den. Columbus. Dulles. Midway. KCI. On time all day long. Plane arrives in KC but wait now the TPA plane is in Long Beach 3 hrs away what happened Southwest? You found out you could fill a plane by delaying passengers 3 hrs? Your gate agents lie! Weather Nope. Control tower nope. Called them out and proved wrong. Oh yeah. Got a $100 voucher on a future delayed flight. Cost me that much in airport meals for 3 hrs. Checked into my TPA hotel at 3 am. Why bother when breakfast was served at 6 am. Not the old Herb Keller airline it used to be. Pay the extra and fly with an airline with an upgraded logistics. Terrible service.
12,"✅ Trip Verified |   The employees were rude when I was confused about checking in my bag after getting an earlier flight, even though the confusion was due to what they told me. They can't even be kind to people for one simple mistake."
13,"✅ Trip Verified |   Purchased the Early Bird check-in for our return flight to Maryland after we experienced to be the last one to board going to Florida. It’s our first time flying Southwest airline so we didn’t know about the seating, A,B C groups they have. So on our way back we got the A group this time upon purchasing the early bird check-in so we me and my husband got the 7 aisle seats which is good and got the window seat for me and my husband got the aisle seat. It was pretty good until when I wanted to use the lavatory but I saw a woman standing near the front seats waiting for the other lady to come out from the lavatory. And after that, when she had her turn, a man stands up same spot waiting for his turn. The flight attendant didn’t say anything to them that it’s not allowed to stand in front waiting. When it was my turn I was just standing maybe on the 4 or 5 aisle waiting so I can use the lavatory. Now here comes the flight attendant telling me that I can’t stand in the aisle waiting. The way she told me was very rude. And she even told me to use the one that is all the way to the back. And why would I go all the way to the back when I’m sitting near the front lavatory. Even my husband noticed how she looked at us when she passes by our aisle. The crew should treat everyone nicely on the flight and not just to certain passengers."
14,"✅ Trip Verified |   My flight itself was great. From Cincinnati to Chicago we were offered a snack and a drink. I had asked for a diet Coke. I didn't get mine. I was skipped on that one. I got a snack though. I just thought they were busy so I let it go. Then from Chicago to Memphis we were again offered a snack and what we wanted to drink. I got my snack but again, I didn't get my drink. Luckily, I had a 20oz in my pure. Although it was hot, at least it was wet. I watched the airline worker give two bags of snacks to customers. Not a bag, it was about estimated 20 or more in a bag. It was huge. I thought so if you tell them you like the snacks, they give you 20 or more bags for free! I had to let them know when I was getting off the plane not only did I not get my drink on either flight I was on today. I guess I just looked like I didn't or was thirsty! I have had much better service on different airlines. Southwest is a thumbs down for me."
15,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight attendants misguided me with wrong info. Burbank Airport uses old fashioned, outdated multi-level and steep ramps. There is a shortage of jetbridges at Burbank. Southwest, the primary carrier there, uses the ramps daily for many of their departing and arriving flights. I have a neuro muscular disability and use a mobility device, a rollator. I leave the rollator at the entrance to the aircraft. The flight arrived at BUR. I asked a flight attendant for a wheel chair at aircraft entrance to avoid the steep ramp. The attendant insisted that there’s nobody to bring the wheel chair up the ramp, that I must walk down. He denied the request. So he lied on company policy. I told the attendant that there’s wheel chair assistance by Southwest employees for getting down using the ramp to the ground. Another flight attendant said I’ll walk you down. So she told me the wrong Southwest policy too. Then she changes the narrative and say’s I’ll get a wheelchair, after I raised safety concern. There are other airline choices besides Southwest. I will consider another carrier for the next trip, since safety is important, and don’t need any games from Southwest crew members."
16,Not Verified | I wanted to express my gratitude to Jose at customer service. I knew nothing about procedures for tickets and flying and Jose answered all my questions and walked me through the process. I'm elderly and he was so patient with me. Southwest is lucky to have an employee like Jose. He is the epitome of customer service.
17,"Not Verified |  I Fly fairly regularly with Southwest and up to now my experiences with them have always been very good. Usually a reasonable price, Always good and friendly people to help out when something goes wrong. I once missed my flight out of Orlando at Christmas time - I was horrified but they managed to get me on another flight and although I had been really upset they made me believe it was not a problem to them at all. So to return to yesterdays flight from Houston to Orlando. Everything about the flight was fine, on time, seating etc great. But I have to say the flight attendant was amazingly funny. Yes they are all amusing and make the journey a little more pleasant but this guy - Alex was his name, was hilarious! I don't know why he is working for the airline he would be great at stand up! Anyway Alex thanks for the fun- it was a delight to spend a little time with you!  This Flight was 407/363 from Houston to Orlando."
18,"Not Verified |  Customer Service was poor on my last flight. I was flying from Panama City to New York (LGA) with a connection in Nashville on a Saturday. My first flight was fine (in flight beverages and entertainment not great, but I have come to expect this with Southwest). My second flight got delayed 3/4 times before ultimately being cancelled at 8.30pm. Again, not usually an issue, but they were unable to rebook me until Monday. The service desk was not able to get me on a flight the next day at all and also wouldn't let me get on standby for any of the Sunday flights. I was willing to accept this, however, I had no place to stay in Nashville. When I requested a comped or discounted hotel room (especially considering I was going to need somewhere to stay for two nights) they declined siting weather as the reason for cancelation, therefore they didn't need to provide hotel accommodation. While I understand what's in their contract, it is an absolutely awful customer experience to be stranded in a city where you have no connections and are essentially forced to pay for a hotel or sleep in an airport for over 24 hours. I would have expected them to either pay for my hotel or try a bit harder to get my on a flight the following day and not two days later. When this has happened to me on other airlines, they have always provided a hotel room free of charge and tried their best to get me on a flight the very next day, regardless of the reason for the cancellation. I ultimately had to cancel my return flight and get a rental car to get myself home. (at an additional cost of several hundred dollars). I will think twice before booking with Southwest again. You could be out much more money than you planned if there is any unexpected weather."
19,Not Verified |  Southwest has become the absolute worst airline out there. Inexplicable delays; terrible customer service; all around horrible. Will avoid them at all costs in the future.
20,"Not Verified |  After being stuck in Baltimore for 6.5 hours and being lied to and no help or answers while wondering the airport with a one year old girl and two year old boy, we finally got to Buffalo and to our destination at 3:30 A.M. when we should have arrived at around 7:00 P.M. desperate to get the kids right to bed we learned  our luggage was ruined as if thrown in a pool because the airline left everyone's luggage in a very heavy rain. Medications were destroyed, study material damaged, sound machines ruined. Our luggage themselves smell now and are ruined, the list is long just to name a few. We filed a claim and the end result was "" because we did not file a claim within 3-4 hours our claim was denied and they want to stand by that. Almost $3,500 in damage and we got offered a $50 and $200 voucher (for their airline of course) which went to $100 after i replied unacceptable. I would avoid this airline or get insurance if you can afford it because we could not and this was the outcome and this airline avoids responsibilities they are at fault for."
21,"✅ Trip Verified | Outbound flight to FLL (737-800) was delayed by about 60 minutes. The flight was diverted to TPA to refuel because severe thunderstorms over FLL prevented aircrafts from landing. Flight finally landed in FLL at 02.20 am 3 hrs later than scheduled. The ICE worked flawlessly and I was able to watch a movie in its entirety thanks to the delay. The only negative: the plane wasn't cleaned properly. The trash bin in the forward lavatory was full and the paper towels needed replenishing. Inbound flight was on a 737 Max 8. Aircraft was very clean and there was plenty of legroom in Row 2. This is a quiet aircraft with curved overhead bins to accommodate all carry on luggage. On both flights, flight crew provided friendly, efficient no-frills service."
22,"Not Verified |  Horrible service, delayed, then delayed again. First time traveling with them and I will never make that mistake again. Claimed free wifi and movies as well and they didn't work for the flight. Do you self a favor and fly anyone else but them."
23,✅ Trip Verified |  Manu I don't know if you will see ever this but there are no words that shall forever express my gratitude for your aloha that got me home. You don't know but you saved and changed my path of life when you helped me that day. I am forever grateful for you being placed there on that very day. 
24,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always loved Southwest. Everyone in my family has flown frequently on Southwest for almost 30 years. But lately they are earning their terrible customer service reputation. Our flight was horribly delayed, I strongly doubted the excuses they gave for the delay, but was pleasantly surprised that each of us received a $250 travel voucher for our inconvenience. However, when we tried to use them, they had already been used by a travel agency in China under the name “Ted Williams.” They are giving away so many vouchers for their own bad behavior that Chinese hackers are stealing them. I complained about how obviously this was not me, but nothing. Southwest phone and online customer service could not care less. Thanks for treating me horribly, getting my hopes up, and then letting Chinese hackers take my voucher. Great airline you have there, Southwest. In the early 2000s, I have no doubt they would have honored my voucher, but they simply don’t value customers any longer."
25,"Not Verified | I am A-List Preferred. Southwest is a disappointment, but I don't think it cares. Under current management it is no longer customer friendly, its systems are antiquated and deficient, it is unreliable, it copiously blames weather to shield its shortcomings (which are many), and its employees are either disinterested or antagonistic. It certainly has earned its pathetic reviews by customers. Hopefully JetBlue will expand its operations westward."
26,"Not Verified | Always happy with Southwest. Love that baggage doesn't cost extra and seating is first come first serve. I recently read that they are also going to begin allowing to move flights around same day if a seat is available or go standby at no charge. This policy only makes sense, if room is available and customer is at the airport why not let them get on a sooner flight. Also takes the stress out of running into an accident on the way to airport and get there late (happened where I missed a flight and ended up driving because I missed my flight!). Over past couple years, I've probably flown 5 times and every flight was as expected. I like the assortment of drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) but wish they had better snacks. Oh and glad to hear internet equipped planes will begin offering free WiFi (if I heard correctly)."
27,"✅ Trip Verified |  Today I flew from Boston - Logan on flight #5231 to Chicago - Midway. The cabin staff service  is very bad service. I required want go to restroom a lot time but staff still refuse, she talk to me in a very annoying way. I ask her name, but she don't answer because she don't have the name on her uniform while another staff service work with her have a name. I think she needs a customer service course again or southwest airline doesn't need such a bad staff."
28,Not Verified |  Excellent customer service from flight attendants (very courteous). Pilot announcements were succinct and helpful. Comfortable flight overall and we landed a few minutes early.
29,"Not Verified |  Worst travel experience in my life! 3 of 4 legs of the trip were delayed by an hour or more. Delay of one portion caused me to miss my connecting flight, even though the staff knew that 2 of us travelers were delayed by SW. They closed the doors while they saw us running to the gate! Overall, my 4 hour flight was 21 hours to get home."
30,"Not Verified |  I almost always fly Southwest Airlines. I find them to be reliable and reasonably priced. I know what to expect in terms of uncomfortable seats and no food. My complaint is the growing number of pre-boarders. I pay extra for Business Select and a boarding number of 1-15. I'm not getting what I paid for when 30 (actual number on last flight) people pre-board ahead of Business Select. My solution is simple, board the 1-15 Business Select customers first, then the pre-boarders followed by the remaining passengers. If your concern is accommodating the legitimate wheel-chair passengers in the first row (bulkhead) simply block that row off. Charging extra for Business Class and not delivering 1-15 boarding as promised, if not fraud, is at least deceptive and leaves the Business Select customer feeling cheated."
31,"Not Verified |  Flight attendants were so rude! Flying out of a small airport in Eugene, Oregon after hiking and the flight attendants were yelling at everyone to sit down before boarding was even complete. Passengers had smaller items in overhead bins which did not allow guests with carry-on luggage enough space. Multiple people were told very rudely they would have to check their bags. This is ridiculous behavior when passengers have paid to carry on bags. Flight attendants should be doing their job by helping passengers, not berating and embarrassing them while they are trying to board. These two flight attendants need a serious course in customer service and how to treat passengers with respect. Appalling."
32,"Not Verified |  I flew southwest airlines for a business trip in Orlando. Although I had a ticketed flight the airlines bumped me to a later flight. They did offer me a voucher for the delay in getting to my destination. Once at the airport at my destination I was told that my luggage was still in Baltimore. As I had a meeting that evening I arrived late for the meeting and was not properly dressed to do my best. I stopped to purchase some necessary items. When my luggage finally arrived, I was told I would get a voucher if I picked up the luggage at the airport, otherwise they would deliver. I received the luggage the next day at 7pm when I got in from work. I told SWA that they should provide compensation for the inconvenience of not having my luggage or files until day 3. I entered a complaint as the inconvenience is going so long without my clothes for 30% of my work trip. They have not responded to my claim since. The inconvenience is not having my luggage and paperwork. SWA, choosing travel consumers want a reliable airline and who stands behind delayed luggage, whether we return to airport to pick up or have delivered. Very disappointing not to even get a response to my claim."
33,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointed in the baggage attendant at San Antonio International Airport. At approximately I came to check in. After retrieving my luggage tag I proceeded to area to drop off bag. There were at least 3 attendants standing around with no customer. I just proceeded to first station. A  lady with a red Southwest Airline shirt on walked and rudely stated I needed to wait until the called me. I advised I wasn’t aware. I’m not too concerned about Southwest Airlines policies if any; however, it was the ladies attitude. Not only did she treat me with disrespect, not one time did she greet me properly, ask me to have a good day or anything. She even slammed my bag on the conveyor almost if she wanted to emphasize her point. I was merely flying home to memorialize my Dad who passed away, You never know what anyone is going through with and a kind word, act or deed could make that persons day better. I did not appreciate this woman talking to me in a condescending, rude tone. If she were in my shoes, she wouldn’t have appreciated it either! Again, I don’t know who this woman is but she is not a good representative for your company. I have been flying for years and have never encountered anyone who behaved in that manner."
34,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airline ever. The customer service is horrible. I thought people were joking when they said how bad Southwest is, no its true. Today my wife changed my original flight from yesterday to today,  and we couldn't cancel our original flight without choosing a replacement flight. So we got a confirmation email about canceling my original flight but no confirmation number about my new flight. After that we called customer service and they said they couldn't find my flight (even after we received our confirmation about my new flight). She was absolutely no help and basically told us to buy a brand new ticket to get home. Horrible service, I hate Southwest and I do not recommend flying this airline."
35,✅ Trip Verified |  1hr delayed arrival at Phoenix 1.5 hr delayed docking at the gate at Baltimore  3+ hr delay in getting luggage at baggage claims after arriving at the airport at 0100 am docking at 0230 and then not receiving bags at current time of 0435 AM. They have very poor customer service and it seems the airline is going down in quality. This was a horrible experience.
36,"Not Verified | I have flown Southwest since I was a child and I am always impressed by the witty flight attendants, flexible seating and free carry-on policy. But alas, I find myself disappointed and distraught yet again. As I write this, I am sitting on the plane because I find the time to act is now. No longer will I sit in the shadows and ignore this issue. There are too many pretzels in the snack mix. It's preposterous. When you hear the term snack mix, you can expect a medley of various chips, crackers and PERHAPS a few pretzels. But what I just ate has no right to be called a MIX. Pretzels plagued my small package and I was overwhelmed. I have fond memories of the old peanut and biscuits that used to be available. Why are they gone? We may never know. Also, though this has nothing to do with the airline, the person in front of me has chosen to recline their seat. Why was this even made an option? And who would do that? I am struggling to sympathize. Maybe I would feel better if I had a well-rounded snack mix in my belly. Thank you for reading, and gods speed to anyone who values the truth and hates false advertizing."
37,✅ Trip Verified | Awful experience all around. 2 hour delay. Slow getting people on the plane. Rude. Why does this airline constantly do this. I had to reschedule all my arrival accommodations.
38,"✅ Trip Verified |  I ordered two coffees, with three sugars each, repeated three times; I’m first row window seat on left behind door. The cabin steward hands me two coffees with three creamers each, no lids; and no tables to set them on. Why couldn’t lids be provided? It took three hours to get my first beverage, I’m up at 5 to make 630 flight, and coffee providers are closed. Thanks for really screwing up a mornings start. I also appreciate that Southwest wants my feedback. Click on the feedback tab to ask what did you use app for? I’d honestly like to know why I did too? Feedback is static, please make no comments; submit. You used to be low cost, now you’re a legacy carrier; and as soon as I’ve exhausted my points using my companion fare; your credit card goes in the back of dresser. So spent on the lesser quality of flying southwest now, used to be fun exuberant staff; but now they treat you like a McDonald's employee would treat you. All the draws that made me loyal are falling to the wayside. You can tell the employees look at this like a job instead of a career. "
39,✅ Trip Verified |  I left my laptop on the plane. Darlene from Southwest baggage claim at Baltimore Washington international airport was incredibly rude and wouldn’t even let me finish my sentences. She literally kicked me out of the baggage claim (7/23/2023). I was not rude to her. It was purely one sided. Worst customer service I’ve ever gotten from an airline! No wonder Southwest doesn’t have a Google review option. They would be inundated with poor reviews about people like Darlene!
40,"✅ Trip Verified | I am writing as a concerned Officer in the United States Army. I usually only fly with United or American and took a chance with Southwest bc I needed direct flights for my kids. I have three children who need to fly to CA to be with family as needed, ages 5, 8, and 15. I’ve never bothered to do early check in bc I’m priority boarding but decided to do it this time since it’s w a different airline then what I’m use to. My youngest being a 5 year old girl was given a seat in C24 when her brothers were placed in C11 and C 12. So naturally I called the airlines. The lady said she couldn’t change her seat. I asked what about priority boarding for unaccompanied minors (the 8 and 5 year old) she shut that down. I explained I need my kids to sit together please. I asked about priority boarding for military. I explained they have military ID cards and I will have mine on me as I plan to wait with them at the gate to see them off. She said “Sorry but no priority boarding for them, we don’t do that.” She was so rude. I explained these kids are new to this routine and it is the 5-year old first time flying w/o mommy with her. The southwest rep could not care less saying that there’s nothing she can do for us! I was very angry. Seeing how less than 1% of the population serves our military one would think they would treat military members and/ or their kids better, especially with everything they go through. Southwest is not a military friendly airline."
41,"Not Verified | LAX-RNO. Only carry-on bags so no airport check-in needed. Thru TSA and right to the gate. Flight was about 30 minutes late but we were informed. 2230 hrs departure so airport fairly quiet. Plane arrived and departed super fast and was only half full of passengers which was nice. Standard beverage and snack offered. Crew were in a good mood as it was their last flight of the day. Smooth quick flight to Reno. Landed, exited and in our car all within 15 minutes. Southwest is always our first go to when flying in and out of Reno."
42,"I missed my flight so I went and got another ticket, that plane got cancelled, then get another new ticket and now it's been an hour delayed. I've been here since 4 am and won't get there until 8pm. Highly recommend you don't go through them and I asked if they would give me credit, they said no."
43,"Not Verified |  The day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from Houston to San Diego. We noticed the change reduced our layover to 40 minutes, so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict. We arrived 6 hours before our scheduled time, so I stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the over-worked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didn't see anything that was better. This phrase came up a lot, but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they don't have control of the weather, etc. regarding delays. The only flights from Southwest that were delayed were those to San Diego (it was not weather related as the flights to and from San Diego were also on schedule except ours). After waiting until we could check luggage (4.5hrs), we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended (5 minute layover). Agent 2 told me that she could only find another flight with 1 seat headed to Boise, but she could only see Houston connections, so I called their 800 number. 3rd agent was an explanation followed by hold/hang-up. 4th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option, but because we checked baggage #4 (the only person willing to help us) had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information. 5th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from San Diego to Boise has 17 passengers and is going to wait for us. I asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection, but that would be unfair to everyone else, so we sat in the back. I knew I was being lied to, but at this point I figured I'd just wait to see what would happen. We fly to San Diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a $100 voucher for a later flight (YAY!). I looked at my pass and it was an ""A"" position which was nice and handed off the other 3 for our family to my wife and went in search of food (terminal was super crowded due to construction) so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit. I mentioned how it was nice that we didn't get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was C-30 and his girlfriend was C-15. I took our passes to the 7th agent (6 was for new passes) and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together. She immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers. I stated that my original tickets were in the A group for that leg of the flight (in an irritated voice), but she stuck to her argument. At this point, I was done with their service, so I expressed to her that I had spent the better part of 12 hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored. She threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor. The supervisor #8 and I had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness, but she would allow us to board together. She mentioned the $100 vouchers, but why would I ever fly with them again - I'd pay not to (and told her so). She also asked why I didn't ask for a supervisor - Isn't that their job when they can't help a customer? Flying with Southwest is just not worth the trouble. They get a 2 rating because their flight staff is actually amazing!"
44,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mine are psychiatric service dogs and even though I presented the DOT form requested with my medical letters the attendant said that my dogs are not considered service dogs, that he was letting it go this time but there would not be a next time. My dogs travelled to Puerto Rico from Tampa and I did not have any issues, and they have been traveling with me for the past 7 years without any issues. While at the boarding gate my whole name was called out through the intercom, I raised my hand and an agent came over to ask me if my dogs were well behaved."
45,"Not Verified |  RNO-LAX via San Jose. No checked baggage, just carry-on so checked in online and off to the gate. TSA in Reno has the new scanners so you don't have to remove your electronics from your baggage. Nice! Flight was running 30 minutes late but we were well informed of this. Light passenger load to San Jose so room to move around. Usual beverage and snack service. Quick stop in San Jose was lengthened to an extra 30 minutes as waiting for arriving passengers to board from another flight. it was understandable as it was about 20 passengers. Still a light load with only half the seats filled onwards to LA. Another beverage and snack service. Arrived into Los Angeles about half an hour late. From landing to driving out of the airport was only 20 minutes so made up time that way. All in all a good experience with pleasant flight and ground crew. As usual we have the best luck with Southwest out of Reno."
46,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest Airlines has become a joke. Flight delays and connections that make no sense. I used to enjoy the airline but now, I loathe this company. They have no sense of customer service and they don’t care about their employees because the employees don’t care about the customer. They get paid before they render you any sort of service but when that service is less than what you expected they they take their time about rectifying the problem.  Flight delays because of staffing shortages are a poor excuse for an so-called major airline."
47,"✅ Trip Verified |  With no assigned seating 12 people took advantage of wheelchair pre boarding. If it was legit it would be one thing but several of these people sprung up while waiting for the plane to arrive to use the rest room and walk all the way to find snacks in the gift store, obviously no issues walking when it was convenient for them. I will walk across the country before I ever fly SouthWest again!"
48,"✅ Trip Verified |  I only flew Southwest once many years ago before flying with Southwest during the Christmas holiday in 2022. My first flight was booked by a corporate travel agency and that is why I flew Southwest years ago. I was among the thousands of travelers who were stranded during the last week in December 2022. I thought Southwest was genuinely trying to make things right with travelers by offering 25,000 reward points, When I went to redeem the points, I was shocked to learn that they had expired because I did not redeem them by March 31, 2023. If the points are not supposed to expire, why have a deadline to redeem the points? This tactic solidified my initial gut feeling about Southwest. I will never fly them again!"
49,"Not Verified |  I was given a boarding pass for gate C 25 at Denver International Airport two hours before my flight. I get there and they tell me the gate has been changed to C 63. I am recovering from a pelvis fracture and knee replacement so can’t walk that fast anymore. I get to C63 and the plane is still sitting there, but they gave my seat away. As though the ticket I purchased doesn’t count for anything! Now my luggage is going to an airport I know longer have a flight to. After the fact, they text me about a flight to another airport later in the day. So clearly they could have texted me when they changed the gate, but didn’t. This is how they treat their customers. I’d rather not fly than ever have anything to do with Southwest Airlines again. They don’t deserve to be in business."
50,Not Verified |  The flight was late. The ground staff could not verify who was on the flight and they seemed confused. The staff went through the cabin of the plane with the manifest asking for everyone to give their name so they might verify what was going on. Very unprofessional with absolutely no consideration for the time of their customers.
51,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked this flight as it was the only option for a last minute need. The first leg was delayed hours, the second leg delayed twice as long only for them to cancel the flight altogether after midnight when no adequate customer service was available to handle the situation. The reason for cancellation was no pilot. Why on earth was a flight scheduled without staff? Southwest then had the audacity to reschedule me on their own flight 24 hours later (without asking) with an itinerary that would involve another long layover. What a joke. I booked an early AM one-way ticket with an airline that isn't garbage (Delta)"
52,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight attendant was saving good seats for people that she decided she wants. Many people (not just my group) tried to sit in the seats but she blocked the seats with her body and gave all kinds of excuses as to why each person shouldn’t sit there. When she saw people that she liked, she unblocked the seats and told them to sit there. I don’t know how she decides who deserves the good seats, but i paid $100 for Earlybird check in (me and my wife) so that we would have choice of the better seats. Two other people in my group upgraded for the same reason but they couldn’t get the seats either. And one of those people have hip, knee and back issues and upgraded so that he would have a chance at the good seats (two knee replacements, one hip. replacement and multiple back surgeries) The whole point of paying extra/upgrading, is to get those seats. I feel jipped. And I really hate to say this but there was some kind of favoritism going on.  Furthermore there was another flight attendant that many people said was rude and condescending. People throughout the flight were trying to get to the front lavatories. The 2 rude flight attendants told several people that the restroom was closed. I understand that they were working in that area preparing our drinks and snacks, but they were very rude to my wife and several others when telling them to go use the other lavatories. I was sitting near the front with my wife and we watched these 2 flight attendants throughout the flight. Everyone sitting near us was watching and talking about the situation too. There was one flight attendant that was very kind and polite though."
53,"Not Verified |  I never write reviews but this experience was so tragic for me I felt like I needed to let off some steam. Some backstory - I just graduated college and am supporting my fiancé as he finishes college. After doing year-round school, I have about $2,000 to my name in addition to student debt I still owe. Since we are paying for our own honeymoon, we wanted something very affordable. We were planning on just going somewhere local when my fiancé's parents shared a 48 hour deal for Southwest tickets to go to Hawaii. They offered roundtrip tickets to 4 islands for under $350. We were ecstatic! Since my fiancé was saving for a ring I was in charge of purchasing the flights. I hurried to purchase them but then we found out housing was pretty expensive so we switched out flight to another island on the deal. Little did I know switching made the deal invalid. This wasn't mentioned in the email. I did notice it cost extra but thought the deal was still on there so the total couldn't be too much (this was my first time scheduling a flight and I was under time pressure so I was a bit naïve). After paying the difference, I looked a the confirmation email and saw that the total was $1250! I was working so I rushed to an office and got a hold of customer service and they told me that piece of information about changing flight locations. Apparently a lot of people were experiencing the same issue. I started crying explaining that I had no idea the deal wasn't applied and if there was any way I could get my money back. They said that if I canceled I could only get flight credit. I hung up and called my fiancé right away. I was bawling my eyes out explaining how I had messed up our honeymoon and we could never afford the trip at full cost. After that phone call I had to go back to work like everything was okay. I know I was a bit naïve but I still feel scammed out of my honeymoon. Please be careful trusting any deal Southwest Airlines promotes because there's probably a catch somewhere."
54,"Not Verified | Canceled flights after making everyone wait both in the boarded plane that wasn't moving for 4 hours (with AC off) took us off and told us to wait, 4 hours later they canceled the flight and did not give us food or a place to stay until the next available flight (all the ones for the rest of the evening were already booked)."
55,"Not Verified |  Treated very badly re: damaged luggage. My (almost new) bag was destroyed. I reported it at the airport and followed up as requested, via their portal. First was offered a travel voucher. Don’t want that. Then I was asked for a receipt for the purchase. I replied that it was a gift I received 2 months ago. Do not have a receipt. I provided the cost for an exact replacement . Then I was offered a very depreciated amount. I asked how they came to that amount (formula - age, cost etc). They did not reply. I called to try to escalate this issue several times. Phone agents were of no help at all. Just said work thru the portal. After a month I was told they would no longer reply to me and my case was closed. Very poor customer experience. I think my request was very reasonable. I didn’t even ask for dry cleaning reimbursement for some of my clothes inside that got wet and dirty. It was raining in Denver. I would NEVER fly with them again."
56,"✅ Trip Verified | Upon family boarding my daughter and I sat in the first 2 rows of the aircraft, we boarded the plane early. I put both our carry ons above us. I was soon interrupted by an un-helpful, nasty flight attendant stating you need to get you bag up or I have to check it. I quickly got my bag in and it fit fine, the woman watched me struggle with no help. Then after the plane had fully been boarded someone boarded the plane that also wanted their carry on to fit, my bag was then removed and placed further in back to place their bag where mine was. After drinks were served my daughter and I weren’t able to finish our drinks as a different flight attendant wanted to take our garbage and said we weren’t allowed to finish our drinks. When we were leaving the plane I asked the flight attendant where my bag was and I was told they didn’t know, and now I we had to wait until the entire aircraft un-boarded so I could get my bag. Once I was able to locate my bag it was in the exact position it originally was in but further back in the aircraft. My daughter and I were treated very poorly as we exited the aircraft by the flight attendant with a snarky, condescending tone “have a nice day”. Not sure how I feel about flying Southwest anymore with my family. We spent a lot of money on tickets and if we boarded early our bags should have had priority over the late comers and we should have been able to finish our drinks, and throw the garbage out when ready."
57,"Not Verified |  Constant delays with Southwest! When it's their fault, they punish you (customers) like we're in the wrong! A exlso, if I pay for a ticket with a certain seat number, I want to sit in that seat! What's the point of purchasing a ticket if it's always open seating! I think that's very unfair and it takes away from customers who purchase a ticket with certain expectations! I recently flew swa and was very upset because again, I paid for a ticket and almost didn't get a seat. If I purchase a ticket for a seat, I want to sit in that seat period! Open seating is stupid! Especially when you have a full flight. Very it together SW!!"
58,"Not Verified |  I fly Southwest every 3 weeks from Denver to Albuquerque on business. The last 8 times the return trip from ABQ to DEN has been delayed or cancelled. Southwest uses every excuse in the book, mostly weather related. These are lies. One flight, where we were 5 hours late getting into Denver, the captain blamed a tornado near DIA. The groundspout (basically a whirlwind) happened at 4:30pm and was 15 miles from DIA. We landed in Denver at about 1:30AM the next morning. Nothing but lies! Last night we were running about 1 hour late (as usual!) When we arrived at the gate we sat in the plane for 10 minutes while the gate agent chewed the fat with a friend ( in her case it was alot of chewing!) and then decided to wadle down the jetway and unlock us. After all why hurry for 120 people waiting in a plane. Unfortunately Southwest and United are the only airlines offering nonstop service between ABQ and DEN. I have been a loyal customer of Southwest for over 20 years and have accumulated several hundred thousand Rapid Rewards miles which I have used. No More! Bye Bye Southwest!"
59,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew out from Denver International to Fort Myers, Florida with my 2 young great grand kids. For verification I asked an off duty Flight Attendant what gate we were to fly out of. She looked at my ticket and told me C25 and pointed. We made our way over with me hobbling in horrible pain as it was hard to walk. As it got closer to the time to board I didn't notice any signs of Ft. Myers, Florida so I went to the desk and asked the gentleman what was going on. He looked at my ticket and said I misread it and that my gate was C64 - the opposite end of the airport. We took off at a dead run and ran the whole way even through 3 conveyor walk ways while he radioed ahead that ""there's a woman and two children running your way."" All I could think about was making this flight. As I got closer I heard 3 times, ""Flight 1383 to Fort Myers is fully boarded and if you want to make this flight then you need to come now or the door would be permanently locked."" I was frantic. When we got there the gal taking the ticket asked me how I felt and that I was blue around my mouth and she needed me to get stabilized with oxygen before she would let me on the plane. I received oxygen for about 10 - 15 minutes then boarded. Two flight attendants not only held the plane for me but saved me 3 seats together in the back of the plane. I've only flown Southwest except for one time with Frontier. I will always fly Southwest. I love Southwest and their cancellation policy, baggage perks and loyalty points with my membership. Thank you to the flight attendants for helping me in this pinch. You were so compassionate and helpful, above and beyond the call of duty. You are assets to Southwest. Thank you to the Pilot and other crew members. I hope I didn't cause anyone to miss a connecting flight as we were delayed."
60,"Not Verified |  Allow me to share my recent experience that left me deeply disappointed. My boarding pass clearly stated that I needed to be on the plane by 3:20 PM, as the scheduled departure time was 3:32 PM. However, due to the disorganized nature of the TSA, it took an astonishing 45 minutes for me to place my personal belongings on the tray for scanning. To compound the situation, the TSA officials encountered difficulties while scanning my daughter's belongings. As I anxiously watched the clock, it took them an additional 20 minutes to complete the task. Finally, I arrived at the gate at 3:13 PM, a respectable 7 minutes before the designated boarding time mentioned on my boarding pass. To my dismay, however, the door had already been closed, and I, along with approximately 8 other passengers who had faced similar delays with TSA, were denied boarding. Consequently, I missed my flight to Ft Lauderdale and had to hastily book a flight to Orlando at 7 PM, which landed at 10:30 PM. On top of that, I had to endure a tiring 2.5-hour drive to WPB, knowing that I had work the next day. As a frequent traveler, missing a plane was a first for me, and it has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with Southwest again. What truly bewilders me is the stark contrast in treatment when delays occur. On numerous occasions, I have arrived on time only to experience flight delays for various reasons. As customers, we are expected to accept such inconveniences, but the differential treatment when delays happen to us is disheartening. Southwest has unequivocally lost my business. To add insult to injury, I had to personally retrieve my luggage from the Ft Lauderdale airport since I was not eligible for free delivery. This entire experience has further deepened my dissatisfaction."
61,"Not Verified |  Totally disappointed in SWA, they left us on the tarmac 35 min after we were supposed to depart Reno. I checked 2 bags in Reno, only 1 made it to Tulsa. This is Sunday, then they tell me “it might be in at 12.30 am.” Now the airline industry is supposed to be the most reliable industry in America. In fact, they train others on reliability. To make matters worse, if it comes in tonight at 12.30 am, they will get it to me “Tuesday” but who knows when. Step it up SWA, American has you beat, they put it on a delivery truck at 6am the next morning. Huge inconvenience as I am a travel Nurse, but my bag isn’t important right, not to SWA."
62,"Not Verified |  Not on time. Delayed due to overlapping flights and passengers trying to make it from far gates. Genuinely just sick of Southwest in overall preference. Their reward program is not worth a grain of salt. A-list priority is a joke, you share the same seating as those that have no interest or desire due to few times flying or something similar. Luggage cabin space is all you receive if you can't complete the requirements of spending goals or flying frequently. There is no such thing as ""first class"" treatment, even the companion pass is whatever."
63,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest has had major delays on my past four flights over three years. Something always goes wrong. We missed our flight, but their delay on the previous flight, by twenty minutes and Southwest couldn’t provide another flight for us home until 1:00 am the next day. We had to get a hotel and rent a car to drive home out of our own pockets. I hate this airline. Unless you are doing a straight through flight don’t even bother. Everyone I talk to has the same experience with them as well. If they would increase their layover times it would fix some of these issues."
64,Not Verified |  We had the nicest smoothest mid morning flight from Orlando to Aruba and afternoon flight back on May 11th and May 17th. Staff was very friendly going down. Very helpful and always smiling. Flight was on time going and returning. Told the pilot at the end of the trips that it was a nice flight and we’re very appreciative. The system for boarding needs to be controlled more in Orlando. It seemed to be in disarray at times. The system in Aruba was handled and controlled very well making sure people weren’t trying to get on ahead of others who were supposed to be boarding first. Hopefully this non-stop flight will continue. Flew it before in the past and happy they got it back again in early 2023. Thank you.
65,Not Verified |  Eric Michaelson was a one of the best air flight attendants I have the experience. I was feeling ill and he went above and beyond to make the flight enjoyable. He went out of his way to offer me a beverage to settle my stomach due to the turbulence. His customer service and professionalism was outstanding. I wanted to thank you as my airline of choice.
66,"Not Verified |  I am handicapped in that I have significant arthritis in just about every joint and am 85 years old. I asked for a wheelchair when I booked the flight, as I always do. This time when I arrived at the airport in Philadelphia to return home (this was a round trip booking) I checked in at the counter and reminded them that I had signed up for a wheelchair. She told me to sit down and one would arrive. This seemed normal as I have always traveled on Southwest and this was the routine. Well, I sat there for over half an hour, periodically asking a variety of Southwest personnel about the wheelchair. They said it was ""on the way"". When my plane was scheduled to board in 10 minutes I began to panic. When I asked at the desk again, the woman said, ""why don't you just walk?"" I was beginning to think that they thought I could walk to the gate and through security and were not going to provide the wheelchair I needed. At that point I saw a person with a wheelchair and no one in it. I asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she ""worked for ...... airline and couldn't take southwest passengers"". Then she said that If I could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me. She told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate. The plane was boarding. It was very clear that, had I not approached this person and practically begged her to take me, I would have missed my plane, my connecting flight and heaven knows when I could have gotten home. This would be a disaster for me given my inability to navigate myself anywhere except short distances, not to mention what to do with my dogs at home whose sitter had to leave for another job. I am disgusted with Southwest and I never thought I would say this, but there is no excuse for what was just totally ignoring my disability needs. When I called southwest to complain they said they could file a report internally but they were not under an obligation to provide a pusher for a wheelchair (in this case there was no wheelchair OR pusher) and I know that's not true. If they don't want to provide this service it should not be offered when I book the flight. Then I would go to another airline. Also, when the person behind the desk told me ""to just walk to the gate"", it was clear that they were not taking my disability seriously and really had no intention of helping me."
67,"✅ Trip Verified |  One way ticket from Orlando to Raleigh on Memorial Day (I flew Avelo on 5/26/23 one way to MCO) on one of their older 737-700s. People like to rag on them for last year’s meltdown and other things but they have come roaring back on one of the busiest holiday periods. Virtually all of the incoming and departing flights out of the SWA terminal in OIA were on time—two delays tops—today. Boarding process was more orderly than Avelo’s (and quicker), left early and arrived early. Dependable service is what I get at SWA."
68,"✅ Trip Verified |  I can’t fly to Chicago for two days due to a rescheduled flight. For the first time we got on a plane and everyone just dropped us off and said that you were leaving tomorrow, and the next day they promised a direct flight to Chicago, but again they outplayed everything and changed the flight 3-4 hours before departure! Now I need to fly with a transfer to Dallas. I paid money for this! Is this an airline or a taxi on call? If you are saving your time, don't fly with this airline."
69,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight was supposed to leave at 10pm. It is now scheduled to leave at 1:19am. Over 3 hrs delayed and there is no rain, wind, or any other explanation for the delay. The cost of this flight was ridiculously expensive, but being with family, due to a death in the family left no choice for travel dates and time. The airport staff say this is a regular thing with Southwest. What happened to the excellent service Southwest was once known for? I can now look forward to little or no sleep before work tomorrow. This has been my worst flight ever! "
70,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am quite disappointed with Southwest. I and several members of my company have been flying Southwest for the past several years because the service and convenience had been exemplary particularly when taking into account the reasonable pricing. I have seen its attributes in many way degrade and some of the competitors improve their standards. I was particularly dismayed after having left my briefcase and phone on a flight on May 16th, 2023. After filing a lost report soon after deplaning, I received no helpful assistance from the airline other than an email three days later stating that they were looking into it and should consider the case close if no further notice had been received withing 30 days. Misplacing a phone these days does not only cause a significant financial impact but the information contained may be critical. For this reason, a more definitive answer than the nonchalant response from Southwest baggage supervisor at Midway Airport stating that they would be drowned in lost items that they receive daily then added 40-50 things including I-Pads, phones, and other items. This statement struck me as particularly irritating since the two individuals at the office were sitting without no apparent task at the time. With the concern that she displayed, I must conclude that the case is probably lost and that the decision to purchase another phone (regardless of cost) should be undertaken. I would have hoped that they might ask me to text my phone to more quickly identify the fact that they may or may not have it in their procession now at the Alabama location where all the lost items from all the Southwest flights go (now many thousands of items per day instead of 40-50). I will remember the lack of concern from Southwest me and my company employees fly in the future."
71,"Not Verified |  I recently had the misfortune of flying with Southwest Airlines, and I must say that my experience was nothing short of a disappointment. From the moment I stepped foot onto their plane, it was evident that this airline lacks the professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction that one would expect. First and foremost, Southwest Airlines had no regard for punctuality. My flight was delayed once, and then they decided to rebook it for an unreasonably early hour in the morning. This unexpected change disrupted my entire travel plans and left me feeling exhausted before I even boarded the aircraft. It is unacceptable for an airline to make such drastic alterations without a valid reason or proper compensation. To make matters worse, Southwest's servers seemed to be in a state of disarray. Throughout the booking process, I encountered multiple technical glitches and slow response times on their website. It was frustrating to witness a company of this scale failing to maintain their online infrastructure, leading to additional stress and wasted time on my end. The flight itself was another disappointing aspect of my experience. The plane's condition was subpar. Southwest Airlines made a promise to compensate me for the inconvenience caused by their multiple delays and rebooking. They specifically mentioned a $200 voucher, which I was eagerly looking forward to. However, even after reaching out to their customer service department, I was met with indifference and received no resolution. It is disheartening to be on the receiving end of such false promises, especially when they have a direct impact on the customer experience. In conclusion, my experience with Southwest Airlines was marred by their unprofessionalism, lack of punctuality, technical glitches, and broken promises. I strongly advise potential travelers to consider alternative options and avoid the frustrations and disappointments that come with flying this airline. Southwest Airlines has left a sour taste in my mouth, and I can confidently say that I will not be choosing them for any future flights."
72,"✅ Trip Verified |  In 2007 Southwest served: 64.9 million cans of soda, juices, and water 11.3 million alcoholic beverages 6.1 million bags of pretzels 103.8 million bags of peanuts 14 million snackpacks 32 million other snacks Just think how much money Southwest would save if they stopped offering all those ""free"" drinks but then the public would go crazy.  Our beverage service has been canceled on probably 8 out of the last 10 flights I have been on.  And no I don't fly the same place so its not likely due to a specific route. But - if you do the math - Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year.  An average soda costs about $0.75 - $1.00 for the airlines, once you factor in the cost of the drink itself (they purchase cans), the cup, and the ice (which isnt much).  On average a flight has about 150 passengers - that's easily $112 - $150 they can put in their pocket when they ""cancel"" beverage service - and that's assuming each passenger only has one drink. On a recent flight (the one I'm on as I write this) - we were once again denied this ""freebie"" service in the name of supposed ""turbulence"" despite a relatively smooth flight.  I've heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision, so I asked. When I asked about this, instead of simply answering my question, letting me know that the captain made the decision, etc. the flight attendant said something like ""let me find out"".   A few minutes later, the captain came on and ""explained"" why he felt it was important to cancel service - essentially providing an excuse for why they did this.  When I asked for the captain's name, so i could verify this with SWA customer service, I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me ""were not going to do that"" and refused to give me his name. He also threatened that they would ""divert the plane""  although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat, not yelling or anything.  I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear - can't have more than one passenger figure out the little secret. Although I dont know what they are so worried about.  Most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience, let alone do anything that could actually make a difference (like report this on social media or via customer service). But still you dont have to ""hide"" and refuse to provide your name if you aren't doing anything wrong.  So this is all being done in the name of ""safety"" - lets go with that. "
73,"Not Verified |  Granted flights were delayed, so the SW terminal was packed. However, my flight was on time. Because of the droves of people around the woman calling out boarding information, I could not hear her. She used a tiny microphone which actually none of us could hear. She then chose to yell out information which no one could hear either. Being my first time flying SW, I unfortunately, hadn’t researched how they board people. I had no idea where “C” was and asked around to finally find where my boarding area was. There was a fellow “C” woman who moved around, so I followed her. She said that since “A loaded, C could now line up.” It was then I figured out what the other number was on my ticket- so I lined up in that spot that was on a sign. As I got on the plane, I asked the flight attendant how I get a seat, “you just chose anything open.” I had no idea. And I had checked my boarding pass and even “pre-boarded.” How did I miss this information? It truly was a cattle call boarding experience. Luckily there were some very nice people to help me along in the boarding process as to where to go. What a joke. What has happened to public transportation?"
74,"Not Verified |  Southwest - maybe fly, maybe not. The gambling of your Vegas trip starts the moment you book a Southwest flight. Will you actually get there, or will they cancel your flight? Well, I am not lucky in cards - so my flight got cancelled just because. No inclement weather, no real reason. Just the fact that Southwest is incapable of doing their job of scheduling and has no care for their passengers time nor plans. So what they refunded the money? That’s not what I was looking for - I was looking to see my friend and make memories. But their rebooking is just ridiculous. Delaying my weekend trip until Saturday night, no other options, no other compensation. They are professional at cancelling flights without a second thought and then basically insulting you with their rebooking. I will never book Southwest again, I would rather invest in a reliable airline to actually get to my destination. Now I have a ruined vacation I was looking forwards to for my first mother’s day and my only option was to cry about it."
75,Not Verified |  Once again Southwest proves it is incapable of getting me to my destination in a timely manner. After cancelling my flight I rebooked only to be delayed twice and left hanging in Burbank.
76,"✅ Trip Verified | I normally really enjoy flying Southwest, but over the last year or so I have acquired a bad taste for them. I flew 11 May 2023 from BWI to Tulsa through St. Louis and I paid for Business Select so I could be in the first boarding group. When I checked in I was A01, which would mean I could get to my choice seat early and get my bag in an overhead bin. Yet there were 20 pre boarders on the first leg and 18 on the second leg - many who walked into the plane (only 5 wheel chairs total) The boarding process has become a joke as pre boarders, sit in the front 3-5 rows. So I think I'm going to request that every time I fly now because I pay $100 or so extra to get first choice of seat and overheard, yet that is no longer available because ALL pre borders have forced those who pay extra to sit in what's left. Sad thing is, many were able to walk to bathroom, get their luggage in and out of the overheads without issue. Southwest needs to recognize those who pay extra for their seats choice and have anyone who wants to pre board be required to sit in the back of the plane."
77,Not Verified | Horrible customer service. Ridiculous boarding policy. Will never fly again. I do not recommend. Pick any other economy airline and have a better experience.
78,"Not Verified |  Southwest has terrible scheduling, delays, being late causing lay overs. What does it honestly take to get a schedule correct, not having hours of delay. No more Southwest for me and my family."
79,"✅ Trip Verified |  SouthWest has left my wife and I stranded in Seattle on our way to our honeymoon to Bali. Flight changes for our international flight now cost 5K and southwest says they are not responsible for flight delays and inability to get me to my destinations on time! I have never had such a negative overall experience during my travels that I had to take a moment just to air out the grievance at 4AM while still traveling.  A short hour flight became a 3-hour overall flight due to inclement weather and being re-routed to Grand Rapids Michigan. I understand that inclement weather cannot be controlled and safety is priority. One would assume as a purchaser of a connecting flight that when a portion of that flight is off schedule the airline will adjust as needed to still get the customer to their destination in a timely manner. I was not given any reasonable options as I was on my way to catch an international flight to Bali, Indonesia and had to be in LAX by 4AM, I was given a ticket to get into LAX at 9:30AM. Adjustments were made to get me flown to Seattle after waiting all night to get my bags in order to re-check them I was treated extremely poorly by the check-in bag personnel who was training another employee. She was very curt, abrasive, dry, and mean. When I brought it to her attention that I had been stuck awake in the airport all night and that I did not appreciate her demeanor she brushed it off and continued in a very aggressive energy to nitpick anything i said or did, such as placing both bags on the scale after the first one had been weighed. When I again emphasized the poor fashion in which she was treating me she said she ""refused to serve me any longer"" which to my knowledge is only acceptable in scenarios of disrespect and while i felt severely disrespected by her treatment of my person, I did not act in any disrespectful fashion toward her. I am distraught as a whole at the incredibly poor showing Southwest is giving me during my travel toward my honeymoon with my wife who lives apart from me due to our work as physicians."
80,"Not Verified | Southwest continues to be our go-to airline with 12 roundtrips this year so far. The service, price, baggage policy, and cancellation/change policy cannot be touched by any other airline. The price cannot be matched by any other airline. After looking at other options, I cannot fathom why anyone wouldn't choose Southwest first. We love em."
81,"Not Verified |  A great experience, amazing flight attendants on both flights. Flights on time a lot of positive energy.. As a 10 year plus loyal customer that's our only airline."
82,"✅ Trip Verified |  Normally fly with United Airlines but decide to try SouthWest airlines since Military Fare discount when you call. So far United is better when it comes to boarding for military first. Military boards after A group on Southwest Airlines. I will probably just go back to United Airlines, unless United Airlines doesn’t do military fare discount."
83,"Not Verified |  I left my carry on bag at the passenger pickup in Las Vegas. Southwest Airlines Baggage Claim not only secured my bag, but went above and beyond to send it to me in St George within 2 days at no charge to me. They were so kind and considerate! Thanks again."
84,"Not Verified |  I had a horrible trip. I booked a trip from Oakland Ca. to Savannah Ga. in Nov. 2022. I HATE flying early, so I booked a flight that had a reasonable, late-morning departure and paid the extra money for a better schedule. About a week before my trip in April of 2023, Southwest canceled my flights and rebooked my whole trip. So, I had to get up at 3.30am to be at the airport by 4.30am for my new take-off time of 5.55am. Exactly what I didn't want and paid extra to avoid. There was no refund for my extra payment when they forced me onto the early undesirable schedule. Then.... On my return home from Savannah, our plane was delayed taking off at the Savannah airport. It turns out the fuel truck for our plane didn't have enough fuel in it. Seriously. So they went and got more fuel and then refuelled our plane which caused a delay to our connection in Houston. We would have had 9 minutes (given the delay for fuelling) to catch our flight in Houston, but Southwest elected to keep the plane to Oakland on time and leave us behind. Great. Now we are rebooked through Southwest for a flight the next day and we are in Houston overnight. And guess what? I have to get on a plane at 6.15am which is exactly why I paid extra money for my original schedule to avoid. The representative at the Houston airport was really nice (Angie G.) and we got a hotel voucher and a $200 Southwest voucher. But this just isn't enough. I'm arriving 16 hours late. I'm staying in a city overnight that I don't care to be in, and cutting my sleep for the second time in a week to keep a flight schedule that I didn't authorize or sign up for. I paid my pet sitter $200 to stay the night in my home and take care of my pets unexpectedly for the extra night. Where is the actual compensation for the 16 hours of my life that I spent overnight in Houston? I had to eat. I had to pay my pet sitter. I lost sleep and essentially, I lost an entire day of rest at home before my work week. This is just awful. I don't know what is going on with this airline, but I have no interest in your voucher to plan a trip with you ever. So......maybe it's time to think about what is actually fair in this awful situation that you created?"
85,"Not Verified | Flight was uneventful. Pleasant. Upon landing at my connection no wheelchair was there for me. And it is in my file too have one. SW ticket agent said wait and one will come to get me. After about 10 minutes I knew I wouldn't have enough time to get to my connecting flight. I found a wheelchair and walked pushing the wheelchair towards my connecting gate which was at the farthest end of the airport last gate. A SW employee saw that I was struggling and had me sit in the wheelchair and he took me the rest of the way to the gate. He wasn't called he just saw that I was having a hard time. I'm traveling again on the 3rd and I thought I should call and make sure wheelchair will be at my gate so I called customer service spoke with a lovely lady. I did not complain about what happened (no one for me there at the gate) but I thought I better call and make sure that doesn't happen again. She was so nice she told me what to do so this doesn't happen again. I felt really cared for and I could tell she was making sure it was clearly in my file. FYI, I may not look handicapped, because I try hard not to. But I cannot stand for very long, definitely can't carry much weight because server double scoliosis, both knees bone on bone and osteoarthritis back, knees, shoulder and hip. This is nobody's business at I don't have to say what my handicap is. If one person reads this and ""gets it"" well, I'll consider that one less person in the world that won't look at wheelchair person like their just trying to slip the line or get a better parking space. Just remember when you see someone in a wheelchair, who gets in and out of it, remember you don't always ""see"" what their going through. I would rather be standing and waiting instead of be getting in a wheel chair in pain."
86,"Not Verified | Worst airline experience ever flying. They are shameful. Cancelled flight to get to funeral, and replacement flight was 6 hours after the funeral. The airline could have accommodated us but despite being on standby, they took only frequent flyer passengers, which bumped us down the list. We missed the funeral. Southwest is the worst airline ever and made no concessions to help us arrive after they cancelled our outbound flight. You are at the mercy of this miserable airline. Highly recommend other competing airlines. "
87,"Not Verified |  Flew last minute, paid a premium, unable to complete early check in due to common last name and S W requiring check in at airport. Would have gladly paid premium to board early and sit next to my husband and store my carry on item. Flight full. Favoritism with the flight attendants for seats and carry on storage. Unable to get a seat next to my husband. Unable to bring carry on, it was within requirements, due to not enough carry on spots on flight. Had to check luggage on connecting flight. Crammed in seats. No guarantee luggage will make to final destination now. Very disorganized. Will never fly Southwest again. Flight leaving 45 min late due to disorganization. No incentive offered even though they new the flight was overbooked and that there wouldn’t be enough room for carry on for flight. Thank you southwest for a great way to start a trip!"
88,"Not Verified | First and last time with Southwest. Delayed both ways. We were in the airport for at least 6 hours waiting for our flight back home. Finally got back just in time to go to work without sleeping. The seats were like rocks, extremely uncomfortable. Even the app works poorly. Only fly Southwest if there are no other options and you don’t have a schedule to keep."
89,"✅ Trip Verified |  I fly frequently for and 9 out 10 times I have a delay with Southwest Airlines. All I want to do is is get home today and once again another delay. Pay extra and book with another airline and get to your destination within  time. I can understand an occasional, but all the time. "
90,"✅ Trip Verified |  LAX to San Jose and back to LAX the next day. Only when we started lining up to board did the ground crew start to activate the aircraft. We started boarding 10-15 minutes later and thanks to the quick work of the Southwest crew, we departed quickly and the flight was delayed by 7-10 minutes. Southwest offers Economy class seats and their seats are not too comfortable nor is it terrible.  I wish that their seats would recline just a bit further back though, There is an open-seating policy, which means that you are not assigned a seat prior to boarding and you can choose where you would like to sit. Flight attendants on Southwest were kind, friendly, and funny. Food and beverages are not exciting as they only offer snacks and a couple beverages like soda and hot chocolate, snacks and drinks are also free, except for alcohol. There are no IFE screens, but you can access a variety of entertainment by connecting to Southwest's WiFi that costs $8 per flight. The WiFi is quite slow however."
91,✅ Trip Verified |  This was my 2 kids first flight. They enjoyed flying into Detroit. The highlight of their experience came on the flight back the next day. Our pilot was a 25 year old female. Beautiful take off and Beautiful landing. She even took their experience further. She let them take pictures with her. Wherever you are young lady please keep doing what you are doing. You bring inspiration to other young ladies. You were so patient and so kind to my kids. I just wanted to thank you for your hospitality and grace. You are one of a kind. If we ever cross paths with you again it would be a blessing. 
92,"Not Verified |  We tried to check in at Bradley International Airport and was told we needed a QR code. We had no idea what that was or how to get it. There were several people behind us and and we were concerned about catching our flight on time. A young agent at the desk took me aside and helped us with the whole form, calmed us down and got us on our way in time. His name is Tion and should be recognized for that. The other agents said they couldn’t help us. Please thank him for us."
93,"Not Verified | we reached our destination at the Austin, TX airport, there was still a plane in the way, and we had to wait before we could unload. While waiting, one of the attendants, took out his guitar and played a couple of songs, to pass the time. It was wonderful. Not only did it make the time go by faster, but he had a really good voice. I had been seated next to a young college girl, who apparently didn't like his singing. She said aloud so that I could hear her, that she was going to notify the airline that she was offended, and that he needed to work somewhere else. She was giggling at that time. She got on her phone and started to look up the airline to notify them. When the attendant stopped singing; I clapped really loud (along with many others) so that she would know that I did like it, and appreciated him putting himself out there, like that. His songs were country music and nothing in them could have been considered offensive to anyone, that I could imagine. I just wanted to let everyone know how ridiculous this young girls behavior was, just in case she did actually do as she said, and try to make him lose his job. He actually made the flight much better."
94,"✅ Trip Verified | I was stranded at Las Vegas on April 8th, I came in on another airline. It arrived late, I proceeded to the gate number on my itinerary. Got there; they had changed the gate number. Had to literally run across the airport to the new gate number. The flight already took off. I had to get the Phoenix, plus my heart meds were in my suitcase that was already on its way on the missed flight. I went over to the Southwest counter, where I was greeted by a very nice gentleman. He took care of me, got me on the very next flight which was boarding in ten minutes and it was two minutes away from my current location. I got on the plane, got a great seat. Was greeted by a very nice woman and a man. I can’t thank them all enough. All in all I was saved and arrived quickly and without incident!"
95,"✅ Trip Verified | I have been flying out to Colorado Spring every month for the past 7 months for medical reasons and almost all my Southwest flights are delayed which is costing me more money on wasted hotels, rental cars and stress. The only thing I can count on is them being late. They are rarely on time. Their flight times are merely suggestions not actual times you can count on."
96,"Not Verified |  Reno-Vegas. As usual flying Southwest out of Reno is a breeze. Check-in using self service kiosk was effortless as was bag drop. We were the only passengers checking in and it was an hour before the flight. TSA was empty so went right on through in no time at all. Arrived at gate and grabbed a bite to eat and then boarded the plane. Full flight, usual beverage and snack while in the air. Free wifi worked fine but since it's only an hour flight not really time to get too involved with the movies and shows offered. Arrived in Vegas and luggage was coming off the belt as we arrived at the carousel. Ground staff and cabin crew all did their jobs and made for a pleasant trip. No complaints."
97,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid for a business select ticket obviously more than an economy ticket only to find out that this does not get you any better class of seat, all I got in exchange for more than double the price was the opportunity to board the plane first. The seats are the same size as Economy the baggage allowance the same and I was 3lbs over and they wanted to charge me $75 usd. Lucky I has a back pack I could move an item over into. Once boarding customers just scramble onto the flight and grab what ever seat they like, it reminded me of back in my school days catching the bus home and all us kids racing to grab the best seats. The people who ended up sitting next to me just purchased economy seats and had the same exact service as me, this is just strange to me that I paid more and got the same seat, the same luggage allowance as customers who paid half the price. First and last flight with Southwest."
98,"✅ Trip Verified |  Took the Southwest flight 2952 from Denver to Ontario and I was lucky that I did. The stewardesses were Taylor, Melissa, and Jennifer and they were fantastic! Special shout out to Taylor, professional, but interactive and attentive. They made this flight enjoyable ... nice work Southwest!"
99,"Not Verified |  Had an amazing flight until my husband got sick, but then was made great again by super helpful attendants who were very patient and caring and made sure he was alright before letting us leave. Thank you so much for having such great staff!"
100,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve flown SW a lot. Usually not a problem. March 14 2023 snow in New England, geez I got up at 4 am drove 45 miles in storm got there two hours early for 8 am flight. No delay notice til 6:37am. Then a cancellation notice. Then a rebook notice on different flight. All with in ten minutes, ok parked car went to Bradley. No one at SWA turned up for work. Well 1 guy did. Not one SW flight came or went at Bradley. Had to book a flight on Delta and pay$$$. Ok it snowed. Other airlines doing there jobs, yeah. Thank goodness SW was not able to buy other airlines recently. Guess they did not fix issues from XMas debacle."
101,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst airline. Flight time was altered via text message a total of 5 times in 4 hours. Ended up being delayed just under 2 hours (surprise! No compensation if under 2 hours, of course!) Requested a pre boarding ticket on check in due to cardiac condition and was not issued the proper designation until we got to the Gate and denied early boarding. Staff was rude and unsympathetic"
102,"Not Verified |  The very worst I have ever been treated was on Southwest Airlines in Baltimore. It was between flights and I needed a wheelchair. We had requested a wheelchair in advance but there wasn’t one available. It took a long time to get to the next flight and the agent for the next flight was rude and treated us like we were the worst passengers ever for being late to the gate. While in the loading bridge I made a comment to my husband and said “ why does she have to be so bxxxxy"" , she heard the comment and forbid me to fly on the flight. I am a 61 year old woman who was waiting to have a knee replacement surgery. I do not feel that my comment would somehow put anyone in danger. The agent did not like my comment and she decided to use her power to punish me. I will never forget this as long as I live. I will not forget the way this made me feel and what I missed that was caused by her using the power of the FAA giving airline employees the right to treat passengers any way they want. I try to avoid flying on Southwest Airlines, the employees have become increasingly rude on the ground. The flight attendants are not as bad but Southwest was always suppose to be the “fun airline”. This could not be further from the truth. It would be so nice to have a seat assignment"
103,Not Verified |  Southwest says at check in they are not responsible for damage to bags. I get to my destination and my bag was damaged. This isn't the first time... Coincidence? Handle with care Southwest. It's not rocket science. Your loading luggage. Don't be lazy.
104,"Not Verified |  I was scheduled to fly home Wednesday, but the flights were cancelled on Tuesday due to predicted snow and rescheduled for Saturday. We called because we can't just spend an extra week because of a bit of snow and they insisted that there were no flights until Friday. I later found out that they were lying and there were still Wednesday flights that they let other people on. They refused to reimburse any expenses that we occurred while being forced to stay half a week, then the Saturday flight was delayed and they told us it was impossible to make it home until Sunday. They kicked everyone with our destination off the plane, then forced us back on so we could no longer sit together in the seats that we had originally sat in and were forced to sit in the middle since everyone moved to the better seats while we were forced off the plane. I still haven't made it home and am very upset with how incompetent Southwest has been. Yes, they are cheap, no it is not worth it."
105,"Not Verified |  Our flight out of Milwaukee was delayed causing us to miss our connection at Nashville for Panama City Beach! I was traveling with my 92 yr old Mother and it was extremely late at night after a long day. Every single one of the Southwest employees we interacted with was professional and empathetic, and did everything they could to help get us rerouted to a flight the next day, hotel and shuttle in Nashville. They compensated us very nicely for the inconvenience. the next day our luggage was not routed on to PCB the way it would have been. The luggage manager, Josie, at PCB went above and beyond to help get it back for us as soon as possible! She was fantastic!"
106,"✅ Trip Verified | I was at the Clev boarding gates and the gentlemen said my purchased 2nd seat wasn’t printed properly and kept my boarding pass but he would bring it to me once corrected. Got on a the plane nothing to hold my 2nd seat and couldn’t get the attention of the flighty stewardess at the front to advise. Once the plane was completely full the guy from boarding gates came and loudly announced to the couple next to me that one of them had to move to another flight due to that seat already being purchased. After they questioned him since they were there and seating is fcfs - he loudly announced in front of entire plane “it’s because of her size it’s a safety issue”. The entire plane laughed and talked about me the entire flight saying I should have been made to get off. I cried the entire flight home of embarrassment since my weight is due to a medical condition. SW promised me a LUV voucher for my “inconvenience” which was routed to the wrong email (not one on my complaint) and then refused to deal with me any further. I am advising please avoid SW if you are of size! When I flew American in the past, they were much more understanding and private in their interactions about my second seat purchase. SW ruined my self esteem and created any future flying with a traumatic experience worrying the same will happen again. SW was very blatant and careless about discriminating against someone of size."
107,"✅ Trip Verified | I entered Premium Economy as I paid the fee to upgrade my boarding status so I could get a seat in the front of the plane on a preferred aisle seat. This was fine in Cancun but, when I was to board in Houston passengers who were taken off the plane were allowed to board prior to those of us who had paid for the priority boarding/seats and occupied the forward seats despite most not having paid for the seats. This also occurred when departing Nashville. The only difference being the passengers continuing on who came in on the flight were allowed to remain on the plane and improve their seats prior to our boarding. I was forced to more than halfway back in the plane. If these people are continuing on, they should board in the respective class with those boarding at the gate. Southwest is basically stealing the upgrade fee as their terrible policy of disregarding those have paid for early boarding despite those who improve their seats without paying for the privilege. In flight wifi/entertainment was not working and there are no charging ports or receptacles to charge devices. This was my first experience with the airline and I plan on it being the last. At least if I pay for Premium Economy or Business class I am able to receive my monies worth. The seats were very uncomfortable. That is enough, I think you get the point. I definitely advise you to find another airline."
108,"✅ Trip Verified | I’m pretty sure that Southwest can not afford to continue to lose passengers. I traveled with a 10 week old puppy. I paid the fee $95. Which I was ok with until they said I had to check my bag because she counts as my carry on. If she counts as my carry on why is there a fee. She’s not taking up any extra space. She weighs less than a normal carry on as well. I was told she had to be under the seat for take off and landing but on the plane the flight attendant was extremely rude. She told me she had to go back in her pet carrier. I explained what I was told and she continued to be extremely rude. I proceeded to put her back in her carrier under the seat, where she remained. The flight attendant came back to ask me my last name and then asked if I ‘she was even a paid pet’. I proceeded to show her my receipt and the tag on the carrier. Stated if she was that concerned she should have checked when I boarded and not half way through the flight. I had my jacket on my lap and every time she passed by made me lift my jacket to show she wasn’t on my lap. Which she never was - she remained in the carrier for the remainder of the flight. They have lost another customer due to very rude employees. If the rule is they have to stay in the carrier for the duration of the flight that should be clearly communicated when checking in. Also there is always a polite way to deal with customers but the employees continue to be unnecessarily rude. I will make sure to tell everyone that travels with pets my experience from now on. Word of mouth travels incredibly fast. ."
109,"✅ Trip Verified | What is going on with SW?? On a return flight from Puerto Rico to Denver, Southwest canceled the second leg of our flight out of Tampa, while we're in the air to Tampa, citing ""weather"". After doing much research and having our local news look into this, it appears that only the SW flights were canceled into Denver, other airlines were arriving as scheduled. The actual statistic for that evening were 47% of SW flights were cancelled into Denver and less than 5% of other airlines were cancelled. The FAA did not issue any closures or delays to Denver. I can't imagine why weather would be an excuse when no one else was using it. After talking to the agents, we kept being told that there were no other flights that evening, when in reality, there were. We just weren't offered those flights. And yes, there was availability according to the website. And they weren't canceled! We received some of the most unapologetic, uncaring, and disingenuous treatment from Southwest Airlines across the board. From the gate agent to the ticketing agent to the baggage agent to the customer service rep. After leaving the airport (because our flight was changed to a 5AM flight the following day), I called to inquire again if there were better flights, I had to wait ONE to TWO hours just to speak to a live person. Our options to return were an early morning flight or an evening flight for a non-stop flight. There was no way I was going to chance taking a flight with a layover anywhere, Southwest is not to be trusted and I didn’t want to get into a situation where we were then stranded at yet another airport. I don’t know what is going on with Southwest and why their business model is falling apart. SW used to be my “go-to” airline (we even had the credit card but have since retired it due to the airline’s inconsistency with flights). If SW thinks it's ok to strand passengers in random places just to make their “customary playbook” profitable, then they are not focusing on what is important. The local news received a disingenuous reply from a SW rep regarding our situation but also showed some telling facts: ""Many of the flights we proactively canceled at the start of today were in anticipation of operational conditions in Denver."" Southwest cancelled our flight in the morning and we were not notified until we were in the air on our way to Tampa. If we had been notified we would have chosen to stay (at our own expense) in San Juan to spend more time with our family, but we were not given that option. Other airlines always lets us know when a flight is going to be delayed or cancelled and they do this in advance and they let us change our flight to a time that works for us. SW does not offer this. Their system is antiquated and not user-friendly. We are disgusted with the treatment we received. They are losing loyal customers left and right. Why do they keep treating your passengers this way? Shame on you Southwest!"
110,"✅ Trip Verified | I had SWA tickets from ONT to ATL with a connection in Dallas. Southwest clearly lost control of their operation on 1/30-31 and stranded me in Vegas. Ok, there was ice in Dallas, but I would have been happy to keep my hotel room and car another day to avoid being stranded. They kept telling me to come to the airport as they had rescheduled my flight. Instead they cancelled my flight FIVE times and promised me each time that I could reach my destination on time. I asked if there was any chance of missing my connection and SW said no. I think they were fabricating stories because they got me to give up my hotel room, rental car. One time in ONT they pushed off from the gate and rode around on the runway and then parked right back at the gate. It was hot in the plane and full of fumes. I got sick on the plane. Once parked again I got off the plane and tried to talk to some one, ANYONE, who could help but there was just one ticket person and a long line of angry customers. I never was able to schedule another connection in Ontario. At one point they said they would take my luggage off the plane and then said they wouldnt. So I got back on the plane prefering to be stranded with luggage rather than without. These Southwest people are rude and crude and have no idea what they are telling people! Why do they feel they have to tell people things that aren't true? Is it just some power trip and they enjoy wrecking the plans of their customers? Anyhow, I eventually landed in Vegas and once again there was no one who knew what was going on. No one could tell me how to get home to Atlanta. I had a boarding pass for the flight to Atlanta but when I tried to use it they said the boarding pass was no good. Some SWA jerk grabbed it out of my hands and said ""Hmm, it says it's for Atlanta"". Anyhow, they told me to go talk to customer service so I lost my seating assignment. At ""customer service"" they printed out another ticket and said to go get on the plane. I tried and again the boarding pass was not working. The whole time they were acting as if this was my fault, even though it was their obvious flawed way of doing things. Any airline this bad should not be allowed to fly. They are completely unsympathetic. Just rude and nasty if you express simple concerns about your schedule or luggage. In one breath they blame it on flight control, tell you what flight to get on, and then it all turns out to be bogus information. Keep in mind that Southwest perpetuated this mess over three days. Maybe somewhere someone was working on it but you could have fooled me. They looked like idiots and no one had any confidence in what they were saying. Southwest made a lot of people desperate for no reason. Ok, there was ice in Dallas but Southwest made the situation 10 times worse by telling people their flights were still taking off and convincing people to come to the airport. This made some people a bit panicky for no reason other than a few airline people wanting to look like they had all the answers. In fact their systems were failing, their people were confused and untrained, and they reacted rudely and aggressively."
111,Not Verified |  We booked a flight with Southwest Airlines from Dallas to Miami a day before we were to board a cruise. We had some bad weather in Dallas and they prematurely cancelled all flights for 2 days. No reason to cancel. We missed our cruise and it cost us over $2500. Never booking with them again.
112,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight was originally a total of 4hr 25 mins and we were rescheduled one night prior and informed that we would not only be leaving earlier but a 6hr layover was added in another city with no explanation given. This turned out trip into a 10+ hour trip. This inconvenienced my family greatly. Also, I traveled with military personnel who is family my entire trip and had no issues anywhere else except for when staff at Gate 41 refused to allow us back with our group. We traveled as a group of 4, he scanned 2 of our passes and refused to scan the other 2 and sent us to the end of the line ultimately separating us and causing issues with our seating. This staff was not pleasant and did not allow our military personnel guest use her benefits properly even after we already spent 6 hours in the USO after once again being inconvenienced. This was my first time flying with Southwest Airlines and I was not pleased at all. I am not sure I’ll be back!"
113,"Not Verified |  Overall, the ride was beautiful, we had flown from 4:00 AM to 7:00 AM to Fort Myers' International and arrived on time and without any issues. Snacks were delicious and the cabin crew was well-rested and ready to serve people if needed. The seat was comfortable but got very hard after the long 2-hour flight. Entertainment was meh because you have to pay a fee to text on their in-flight internet service."
114,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I have been traveling on Southwest for nearly three decades and generally appreciate their service or that they do their best to be helpful when travel plans go sideways. In fact we just had a trip through Southwest Vacations that was fantastic. Our latest experience with them, however, has been both eye-opening and frustrating. We had booked flights for February 2nd from Puerto Vallarta to Reno with a connection in Phoenix. We had flight 1299 from Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix and then flight 547 from Phoenix to Reno. We received an email from Southwest notifying us that our flights were changed from Puerto Vallarta to Denver and then Denver to Reno. We had seen this Denver connection when we were initially booking our trip however we did not want to fly from Mexico to Denver in the dead of the winter. Too much of a chance of being stuck in Mexico. I went on the Southwest website and could see that our original flights through Phoenix and on to Reno were still there and they were still selling tickets for these flights. I called Southwest customer service and asked that our flights be changed back to our original flights. The customer service representative changed us back to the original 1299 flight Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix but informed us (here’s where things got wonky) that we could no longer choose our original Phoenix to Reno flight 547 because the two flights were no longer ‘linked’ in their system. I asked her what she meant by that. Apparently, Southwest links certain flights together so when you search for a flight from A to B with a connection in between it will only show you these ‘linked’ flights. There may be other connecting flights that are departing earlier or later depending on your needs but you will not see them because they are not linked flights in their system. So our original flights were ‘linked’ when we booked them but were then ‘unlinked’ and changed by Southwest to Denver. And when I tried to change them back I was told that is no longer an option because those two flights are no longer linked. The only ‘linked’ flight through Phoenix was a 5-hour and 20 minute layover in Phoenix and then a flight stopping in Vegas and traveling on to Reno. I pointed out to Southwest that there was an earlier flight 867 through Vegas and on to Reno with only a 2 hour and 10 minute layover. I was told that was not an option because that was not a ‘linked’ flight. Seriously! You changed our flights! You un-linked our original flights and refuse to do anything to restore our original flights or alleviate the lengthy delay you left us with. C’mon Southwest you can do better. At the end of most flights the flight attendant will say ""We know you have a choice in flying and we thank you for flying Southwest."" And so my wife and I will spend our 5 hour and 20 minute layover contemplating our future travel plans and considering if it's time to exercise that choice. "
115,✅ Trip Verified | Very impressed when baggage unloaded in Houston. Every bag on the carousel was stacked neatly with handles facing out so we could easily grab them! I have never seen this before and made my long day of traveling have a happy ending ! Thanks to the baggage handler for caring about your customers!
116,"Not Verified |  We were part of the mess at the end of December 2022. Got the notice while we were on a cruise. I immediately booked a car one way realising flights were not an option that time of year, and would be super expensive. I feel extremely sorry for stories I've heard. I feel really bad for the employees of Southwest. Someone needs to get their act together for sure. We were refunded all travel and receipts sent in within 2 weeks. We are good. I hold no grudges."
117,✅ Trip Verified |  I have had more than one issue with Southwest the past 3 times and am absolutely disgusted. I was forced to give up my seat to other people after I boarded first as an A class member. Then the airline lost my luggage on my flight home because it turns out they decided not to put it on the plane and when I was told it would arrive and I would be contacted I wasn't. I was called at 12am and woken up. Then I had booked a flight home Dec 22-29 to fly home after life saving surgery to spend Christmas with my family until my flight was canceled twice so I ended up having to spend Christmas alone and lost money due to paid appointments thanks to Southwest. I rebooted my flight and requested assistance which was not given after I specifically told them I couldn't lift per Dr. Orders but didn't get help until second time where I had to go through security again andI had to pay fora carry on bag. I was told I would get a flight credit due to SW canceling my trip because they sent my mom one. When I called to ask about it again they told me I don't get one after I had been waiting for the email I was promised. I am beyond disgusted as a customer and if the situation is not handled I will not be using SW again and will make sure to tell everyone I know not to use them either. They are a dishonest company who doesn't care about their customers or taking care of them as promised. I understand mistakes happen but what happened to me is not acceptable and won't be tolerated. I deserve respect and for SW to keep their word.  I'm tired of being told no one will do anything for me. I have flown SW for 15yrs with no problems until recently when it been nothing but awful and I'm considering switching airlines from now on.
118,✅ Trip Verified |  FAA delay today is understandable for delays. However once flights are active again and we are delayed for an additional hour here hour there due to Southwests inability to have flight crews ready once FAA problem was resolved. You can only blame FAA for the morning delays not the lack of preparedness by your company.
119,"✅ Trip Verified | Ancient computer systems cost millions their holidays and huge additional expenses. I'll never be flying Southwest again as I don't trust them to get their own employees home, let alone paying customers."
120,"Not Verified |  This airline delayed for over an hour on multiple flights. This last one was apparently due to paperwork that needed to be done before we took off? I'm not sure what kind of nonsense that is but it's sounds like a complete waste of everyone's time. Instead of getting the entire plane where we needed to go we sat at the gate for hours due to this ""paperwork"". I used to love flying Southwest and now I will choose a different airline that actually cares about their passengers."
121,✅ Trip Verified | We were one of the lucky ones to make it to our destination as we are coming in for a cruise. With all the issues Southwest was having creating the “perfect storm” I cannot say enough about our crew heading to Houston. They were so friendly and helpful with us get to our connecting flight which was leaving 5 minutes before we landed. Our Captain on the connecting flight to Fort Lauderdale waited for my family and 8 others being the last flight out that night. He said he wasn’t leaving anyone behind. Truly grateful! The baggage assistant in Phoenix was great too. Our first flight was delayed 1 1/2 hours but all the staff sure made everything great by staying positive. Bravo SW employees. Hopefully the airline will fix all the glitches for their customers and employees. Certainly have been through a lot this past week.
122,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ridiculous disaster that is embarrassing to say the least. They didn’t update their scheduling software! I have had to buy another ticket with another airline two days later than I was due home. I’ve missed work, had to pay for two more nights in a hotel than expected. The weather was bad in some parts of the country, but  other airlines are up and on schedule. Not Southwest, because of all those canceled flights, Southwest was responsible for 90 percent of those cancellations. This was my first and last time flying Southwest. Shame on you Southwest, you have failed a lot of people in this country ."
123,"Not Verified | I was scheduled to fly out of Omaha Nebraska on December 26 at 12:45 p.m. My flight was delayed twice, and then eventually canceled. This has been quite a fiasco. Southwest offered no help whatsoever to the people who were on these flights. I waited in line at the airport for two hours to get a refund on my flight. When I finally reached the agent, I was offered a $200 voucher that would expire within 12 months, however, I was told that they could not refund my money at that time. I would have to call their customer service line. I have tried calling, been unsuccessful have been on hold and disconnected six times in total have spent 30 hours on hold. Just trying to get a refund for a flight that this airline themselves canceled. Reason for cancellation was not leather related. It was due to the fact that Southwest agents overbooked flights that they had no crew to fly. I will never in my life flying Southwest again three times I have flown Southwest I have had issues every time. This is an absolutely horrible, horrible airline. The true sadness for myself is that I was going to see my two grandsons that I haven’t seen in nearly 4 years. Also going to see my mother who has had stage four cancer. This airline has done nothing for anybody to reconcile the cost, the heartache, the time that we have wasted, and that has been stolen from us. For those future travelers, do yourself a favor and even if you have to pay a little bit more for a different flight also. Do not fly Southwest airlines."
124,"Not Verified | Flying alone, my 14 year old daughter’s flight was canceled Dec 27 after assurances that the plane was at the gate for the first flight of the day. No crew arrived. Supervisor told me she didn’t care that my 14-year-old was left in the airport with no offered flight for 5 days (Jan 1) and told us on the phone that we would have to figure something out. She handed my child a $200 travel voucher and ignored her after. Delta moved heaven and earth to get her on a plane 4 hours later."
125,✅ Trip Verified | Unforgivable terrible airline. They opted not to upgrade their technology causing massive cancellations and delays across the board. Then to rebook our flight there was a 2-3 hour wait. We lost all of our luggage and have no answers. We were left stranded 3000 miles from home. This was the worst airline experience of my life hands down. Shame on you Southwest.
126,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest should be ashamed of themselves for leaving customers stranded while randomly canceling thousands of flights at the busiest of travel times, and then instead of trying to assist those customers proceeding to cancel 70 percent of their flights for the next week while other airlines are doing everything they can to get back on track, and to claim their customer service lines are fully staffed is an outright lie. I called numerous times only to be put on hold for long wait times and then disconnected. Used to be great ... have become a pay to play that screws its customers every chance it gets to falsify cash flow records and cook their books.  They have certainly lost a loyal customer.  Its hard to rate the services individually as they just can leave flights and customers had no flight experience to rate. "
127,"✅ Trip Verified |  Stellar Employees at Southwest, ground crew, attendants, Pilots etc. True dedication to their work and doing their best during these challenging times. Our Flight was delayed multiple times, during that time I was able to do some research as to what was going on. Due to severe storm activity across the country many airlines had to cancel flights. Southwest included. I understand people being upset, but what I appreciate is Southwests ongoing communication to let their passengers know ahead of time that the Airline and Flights were experiencing ""Irregular Operations"", they clearly assure their passengers ahead of time: ""If your flight was canceled and you would like a refund, please submit a request"". So I went fully knowing my flight could be cancelled. Of course multiple delays, the ground crew communicated with us multiple times, telling us they were doing what they could, that something had happened to their network. could have it been hacked? or challenges with having to cancel flights due to storm activity? Regardless, this airline wouldn't have cancelled if they felt the airways were safe, or they had the capacity. Then to our amazement they were able to organize the crew offline and get us on our flight home. These are trying times, shutdowns due to mysterious viruses, freaky weather. Some things can't always be controlled or predicted, but the response is what matters. Southwest is doing a great job despite the circumstances and I will continue to fly with this airline!!"
128,"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed flight 3x just to be told it's cancelled literally 30 seconds before boarding. We waited hours in line to rebook the next flight tomorrow. Tomorrow comes, same thing happens. They delay our flight 3x once again. After that, I knew they were bound to cancel at the last minute once again. So, I left to go home without even rebooking. I checked my email and ""surprise"", they cancelled it last minute before boarding. I feel bad for the passengers who had hope and stayed waiting all night. Thanks Southwest for ruining my family's Christmas and thousands of other's as well. I guess if I want to visit my family on holidays, I'll remember to never book Southwest. Truly unacceptable and unforgivable. I'm 100% paying more to fly Delta now. Learned my lesson. I forgot to mention they sent all our luggage without us. So my clothes, toiletry, belongings, and necessities are halfway across the country from me. "
129,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight delays because of lack of Staffing, long wait times of just sitting on the plane for hours waiting to see if they are going to decide to fly the plane only to cancel after waiting for 8 hours and this is not due to bad weather only, because employees don't want to work then. They lost my luggage, I never received my luggage I was wearing the same clothes for 4 days only to catch a flight home, and on the change over, still no employees. Flight canceled after being delayed every hour until after 8 hours they decide to cancel which left me stranded 12 hours away from home, which caused me to get a rental car get a hotel drive home on borrowed money, because I hadn't intended on spending that much money due to their incompetence."
130,"✅ Trip Verified | First my flight was canceled on 12/25, missing a days work to get here in the 26th and have the flight delayed until well after 7 pm. The excuse, allowing other passengers to board. This wasn’t their flight and now we’re being inconvenienced having to wait. We should’ve been off at 4:25 but they’re so understaffed that they didn’t even have flight attendants, luckily 3 women jumped in and took the job. As we’ve sat on this aircraft for more than 40 mins while they try to gather other passengers. We don’t get discounted tickets or anything for this wait. And yet this is just supposed to be ok. We should’ve landed a hour ago. All to fill seats. They flight was already full. So we’ve have to wait, for 3 passengers. No thanks Southwest. This was it for me."
131,✅ Trip Verified | 0/10. Absolutely ridiculous. Winter storms are not a viable excuse-all other airlines are still operating. Southwest took something from my family that we can never get back. I could not be more upset or disappointed.
132,"✅ Trip Verified |  On Saturday 12/24 I was at the airport by 10:15 for my 12:15 boarding of Flt 2909 to Manchester. I'm always early. It was delayed to 1:45 then cancelled by 11:30. Got on line, no flights to Manchester so I booked one to Boston that stopped in Tennessee first, I think that was Flt 3223 scheduled for 5:45 PM & landing after midnight. I took it. I will pay the $200 + for car service to get to New Hampshire. I went downstairs got my bags from the Manchester flt & checked them for the Boston Flight. Went through security again. At 3:30 that flight cancelled. They told me I could rebook for Monday morning flt 3159 several stops but you stay on the plane to Boston get in 6 hours later. I booked it. I was told my bags would be downstairs again. I went downstairs was told over & over again by the staff downstairs my bags would be down as soon as they could. 8 hours later when the baggage doors closed I was told no more bags coming down I could speak to a manager but there were no managers downstairs, I could go upstairs. I did & guess what, no manager there either. I went home bagless & exhausted. I asked at least ten time & was told the bags will be here. There was no real security watching these bags I had the Christmas gifts for my family in one bag & all my winter clothes in the other. I would have left, if I felt they would be secure. I wish I had. I stayed home Christmas my 3rd flt was cancelled. I tried calling Southwest on hold the first time 3 hours had to hang up & then 4 hours on hold & then disconnected. I went back to the airport on 12/26. Got on line 7:15AM to try again, to get a flt. to Manchester. I was on that line for 4.5 hours. The reason it was so long is that we were not important to Southwest They had 3- sometimes 4 employees at the counter & 3 & sometime all 4 of the Southwest employees would take the A list people that just walked into there lane, that haven't waited more then 5 minutes. So basically the group of over 150 to over 200 people were left with sometimes, one person, who was at the end of the counter, to assist them in finding a new flight. How disgusting! How belittling to treat your customers with such disrespect. I finally rebooked & now for the last time I'm going to try to get to Manchester on 12/28. Now, I go downstairs to get my luggage, you know it, not happening. Its no where to be found, so what are my options a line, 2 hours later, I get into the luggage counter and ask, where is my luggage? My last flight was flight cancelled yesterday? Well the young man says, one bag in is Boston & one is still in Tampa. I didn't go to Boston but my bag got a spot? I told him the other bag is not here I looked for it several times. He said well it could be on a cart somewhere & we don't have the staff to look for it. You had the staff to send one of them to Boston? Was it an A list bag? I asked how do I get my bags? He said once you land in Manchester you can request your bags. What? Now you want me to get in line in another state? I know that Boston doesn't fly to Manchester? So what you're telling me, is they will fly my bags somewhere else & then to Manchester? Do I get the mileage points or do my bags get them? Also by the time my bags get to Manchester, if, in fact, they do find them, I will either be in NY or back in Tampa. The only warm clothes I own are in one of those bags. He said there was nothing he could do to help."
133,"Not Verified | Don’t think I would ever fly this airline again during holiday season. They cancelled two flights in my son in Denver, telling passenger’s the last minute and all the whole saying the flight was delayed. Then they refused to even offer any accommodations to stranded flyers who had to spend Xmas eve and Xmas day on the airport floor. We waited 5 hours in hold to try to get another flight. Horrible experience all the way around. They also had no flights into Monday and cancelled my other sons flight on Tuesday 12/27. We ended up using United much better!"
134,"Not Verified | Weather delays and even cancellations as happened on 12/26/2022 are to be expected. However, my daughter and her family were on two cancelled flights today. They were told that they couldn’t give them their luggage and that it could be days and that they wouldn’t call them! They just wanted their bags so that could drive to their destination. I’ve never heard of a cancelled flight, where they can’t give passengers their bags off of the cancelled flight in the middle of the day and they couldn’t begin to know how many days it would take to get their bags back. Not because they were lost, because they wouldn’t take the bags of the plane. No transparency, no competence, no compassion and no urgency to serve customers. They should be ashamed!"
135,"✅ Trip Verified | What a terrible experience. On arrival we wait an hour on the tarmac for a parking space. On departure we wait 2 hours for more passengers, not to simply board, but because they had seats to fill. Never again. I suggest anyone considering Southwest to immediately think otherwise if you have a life, or a schedule to keep"
136,"✅ Trip Verified |  Was all set to fly home today, after a 10 day trip away from my husband. Checked my flight status before I left for the airport and all was well. Get to the air port and go to check my bags, terminal says my flight has been canceled. Lady at the desk had absolutely no sympathy and wouldn't help anyone from the dozens of canceled flights. She just told us to rebook online or through the app. I couldn't get another flight for 5 days, so I am stranded here for 5 days. All other airlines wanted $800-$1000 for a ticket any sooner than that. Absolutely shameful and disgusting to be gouging prices like that. This has completely ruined my holiday and caused my depression to sky rocket. Thanks a lot Southwest."
137,"✅ Trip Verified | We are family of three (myself, husband and our infant) and frequent Southwest travelers since last 7 years. We were scheduled to fly out to and fro to Dallas from LGA on Thursday (Dec 22, 2022). Before we even started to the airport our flight got cancelled. It makes total sense given the circumstances of thunderstorm just the previous day. We got our flights rebooked for Saturday (Dec 24, 2022). The rebooked flight had stopover at Chicago (MDW) before reaching to DAL. Right before boarding the flight at LGA, the gate agent informed us about the cancelled flight from MDW to DAL. Since, we did not have a place to stay in MDW, we cancelled the whole trip and informed the gate agent about our decision. However, our bags got checked in and could not be taken out from the flight. For the next two days - Sunday and Monday I have been going to the airport and standing in line for 4-6 hrs on each day because no one responds to the phone. My wife has been on phone to get hold of an agent for almost 4 hrs everyday but in vain. Following are the major issues with Southwest: 1. In the name of winter storm there are coming with lame excuses. There is impact of storm from Wednesday till Friday. Every major airline except Southwest recovered from it and resumed their operations. However, Southwest has major operational meltdown everywhere. This is fact ! 2. You lift the damn phone and answer the customers. You are causing agony and anxiety by ripping apart our once in a year holiday break. 3. Our Checked in bags are gone, money did not get refunded, vacation is gone, peace of mind is gone. Shame on you Southwest Operations Team. I feel bad for their customer representatives who take all the anxiety from customers. Where is the operations head at Southwest LGA ? Face the customers, accept the fault and take appropriate measures to get the trust back !"
138,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had my flight scheduled for Christmas Day - looked at the app before heading to the airport, all was well. It wasn't until after dropping off my bags and getting through security did I notice an overwhelming number of people at each gates. Doubled - checked the monitor to see if there were any changes, and there was. About a 45 minute delay to my Midway connection before heading to Minneapolis-St. Paul. Maybe 20 minutes later I checked the app and it said the connection was cancelled. I did not receive a text notification that it was cancelled. Talk about lack of visibility. Tried making it easier on the airline by rebooking my own flight through the app, didn't work, tried the website, also didn't work. Kept receiving an error code. Mind you, I have no luggage on me (I checked all of it). Then, I wait 1.5 hours in the guest services line, while trying to reach their phone line to be instructed that I could've been rebooked on another flight but it ""just had left""... so it was a time and place thing which could've been solved if the app or website was working, or even if I had received a notification earlier in the day. They then rebooked me for another flight for the 26th that was then cancelled at 6:30am this morning. I swear it was a ghost flight to hold people over to be disappointed another day later. It's 11:33AM and I waited on the phone for 2.5 hours to be disconnected. My luggage is in an unknown location, and I am utterly frustrated and sad. I am lucky I only have to think about myself traveling, but I can't help think about the families with children and elderly, those travelling to see their loved ones."
139,"✅ Trip Verified |  I do the majority of the travel for 16 people. I, and my family are extremely upset with SW. This past year with all the canceled and delayed flights, it has been a nightmare. Most all of these flights were DAL - MCO and RT on non- stops. But we pushed through hoping it would get better, trying to understand. Birthday flights to Orlando, disastereous with seriously delayed flights. For 7 of our party. Costing us empty non refundable hotel rooms, theme park tickets and the stress of all of us not being togther for my birthday. Canceled flight for 3 trying to get to HHN at Universal Studious. Tickets bought and and a hotel room unused and non refundable. These two stick out but the worst of all, is our Christmas flights. My husband and I were set to fly to MCO on a non stop and Christmas eve as we try to check in to find I get a seat and he does not. SW split us up, and put my husband on standby with 15 people in front of him. To make matters worse, just hours before we have to drive an hour & a half to DAL cant get anyone on the Phone. We were left on eternal hold, hung up on 4 times and upon calling back received several busy signals. The bottom line, SW ruined our Christmas. Again we had non refundable hotels stays. And the memories we missed are priceless to us. AND this morning, they canceled our minor childs flight on a non stop from ATL - DAL. She was supposed to be home today but now she can't get home until Thursday. I don't need excuses about the weather. There is no weather in the south. If there is a problem where ever to Dal, pull out a plane from the hanger DAL, it is their hub. Stop over booking, Your airline has cost me $2100 in unused, non refundable rooms, $1200 in unused park tickets, and stress for our family ALL year. We missed out on happy memories to be replaced with anger and frustration. We will be closing all our SW Rapid rewards accounts, and our Chase SW Credit cards. They are no longer reliable. We can not count on Southwest Airlines for our family trips. They cost us more then money, but memories. We have an up coming flight to HNL that we are price shopping to other airlines because of their unreliability. I am just heartbroken. What happened to SW?"
140,"✅ Trip Verified |  4 flights cancelled due to storm except there wasn't a storm anymore. I was in contact with my wife, storm passed 3 days ago. Yet every flight was canceled. Last flight the flight crew never showed up. They won't give me a refund, only credit. Like I want you use their incompetent company again. My holidays were ruined by Southwest Airlines. There was nothing to do with mother nature, sheer lack of ability to fulfill the ticket."
141,"Not Verified |  I purchased a ticket for my son to bring him home for the holidays. First his flight was canceled before he even left for the airport. They did rebook him on a later flight. When he did get to the airport, his flight was delayed for over three hours. They finally took off and he made it to Chicago Midway where he was supposed to connect to Salt Lake City. Fortunately his plane for connecting flight was also late. Now here is where it gets really good. It is now the middle of the night, the pilots show up, but two flight attendants have not shown up and the airline claims they cannot get hold of them. The flight crew from another airline who had their flight canceled volunteered to step in. Southwest corporate refused. One flight attendant show up but now  pilots have been too long without sleep and so canceled the flight. Now he is stranded in Chicago. What happened to the airline Southwest used to be? We will never use them again."
142,Not Verified |  We were supposed to catch a flight from Denver to San Diego at 6:10 PM. When we got to the airport the flight kept getting delayed. At one point it was supposed to leave at 8:30 pm. We went to get dinner since we had time to wait. Then they moved it back to 645 pm so we had to get our food to go before it was even made to try and catch the flight. We then went to the new gate that our flight was supposed to be at and waited. All of the sudden we got notified that the gate moved again. We got ready to move to the next gate and then we were told by a southwest attendant working there that our flight was canceled. So in sum we’re now headed back home without our luggage after a very long day at the airport that took us nowhere. Terrible experience.
143,✅ Trip Verified |  Been on hold for 5 hours to get an update on my bag that has been missing for 2 days and cannot even get ahold of a staff member. If an airline looses you luggage there is an expectation that they can at the very least be reached for updates. Especially since I traveled from a location that was 75 degrees to 35 degree weather.
144,"✅ Trip Verified |  Long-time SWA frequent flier. Completely disappointed in SWA competency, customer service, and integrity. Weather delays do not justify SWA dishonesty nor decisions to not staff appropriately to support the customer in trying times. SWA agents at MDW either need to be trained appropriately and/or replaced by those more highly motivated to serve. SWA executives, you failed to prepare your business for an event for which you had plenty of forewarning. Blame lies at your feet."
145,"Not Verified |  Southwest cancelled my flight just hours before departure and bumped me into a flight 2 days later. I was going on 5-day vacation that has just been shortened way too much. It upended all my plans and reservations. All my money and time planning lost. The worst experience ever! I understand a delay of a few hours or even a day, but more than that when the weather is actually nice makes no sense at all! Get yourself together and solve your staffing issues or stop selling flights if you can't manage to operate well enough!!"
146,"Not Verified |  Southwest canceled a flight forcing husband to spend the night in the airport. Then gave him misleading info as to the location of his luggage. Today they refused to answer the phone. We went to the Baltimore airport (where my husband had landed) in hopes of retrieving the bag. 2 hours spent in line to be told the bag wasn’t there, and we would have to wait in line at the baggage office at Reagan National (where my husband was supposed to land but the flight was canceled). I am stunned that a company with such poor customer service somehow stays in business. We will never use them again."
147,Not Verified |  Flight from Milwaukee to Denver Denver To Vegas for December 25th 2022. It’s ridiculous I was all checked in had boarding pass sent to me. Paid 25.00 for early check in. (Lost that) Only to receive a text at the last minute that my flight was from DEN to LAS was cancelled. I waited 2hrs and 28min to speak with an agent for him to tell me there is nothing he can do. So I had to find me a flight from Denver to Las Vegas which cost me 200+ dollars. The best part was he only could refund me $40.00 because it was due to the weather. Count your days SW especially with me.
148,"✅ Trip Verified |  What a sad joke this airlines is claiming that there was no pilot. I have never heard of such a thing. I was flying to see family for Christmas Eve and they canceled the flight. I have never missed a holiday with my family until today thanks to this airline, not even when I was in the military. I tried calling the customer service number but either the line was busy or the call dropped when I was about to speak with an agent. I'm canceling my rapid rewards program and never using them again."
149,✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight was delayed 4hrs due to missing 1 flight attendant then canceled. Our flight attendant literally showed up 1 min after our flight was canceled and they couldn't do anything about it. Only offered $200.00 in flight credit for all three of our party. Not 200 per person but 200 total. Wouldn't reimburse the flight either. 
150,"✅ Trip Verified |  Two years ago Southwest cancelled my flight hours before takeoff. I had the extra money in 2020 to rebook with another airline, but due to the current state of inflation, I could not afford to purchase a new flight. My flight was cancelled on 12/23/22 and I have spent over nine hours on hold trying to speak with someone. The one time a person answered, he couldn’t hear me due to the static in the line. I have not been able to reschedule so my Christmas plans along with other millions of travelers is ruined! Thanks Southwest for your poor planning. I do not want flight credits! My hard earned money needs to be returned to the card my plane ticket was purchased on. Moving forward, I’ll pay more and book with American or Delta airlines. I hope that the FAA can impose some type of substantial fine for this airline."
151,"Not Verified | My dad and brother had their trip out of Denver cancelled last minute by Southwest. They could not get hold of the customer service line and had to wait in the airport line for 2 hours before being helped. They were booked on another flight, which was then ALSO cancelled. We will not be booking with Southwest again."
152,"✅ Trip Verified | Chaos at the airport - not enough staff. 1.5 hours to make it to baggage check. 1 hour to make it to baggage drop. Boarded on time. Completed 30 min early. Airline decided to wait for 3 passengers. Delayed departure by 50 min. Result: had to swap crew. Took 30 min. We’re missing customs paperwork. Took another 30 min. I love Southwest as I’m a frequent traveler, but this is gross incompetence. Wish this was Europe where airlines have to pay $$$ for their incompetence. Time for the US to make some changes. These airlines need to be held accountable table after doubling fares in the past two years."
153,"✅ Trip Verified |  Winter storm Elliott creating chaos, but had a direct flight booked 12/24, returning 12/29. There are 12 flights 12/24 from RSW to Columbus, 10 flights with at least one stop and 2 direct flights. Got notice 18 hours before departure flight is cancelled, and they rebooked us on a non-direct flight 12/27 returning 12/29. They only cancelled the direct flights, and the 10 non-direct flights are all still on schedule. This is the second weather event we have had and they cancelled only the direct flights on the previous trip also. Probably will stop using SWA after I consume the travel credits on my account."
154,"✅ Trip Verified | I was supposed to fly out on 12/23/22 at 10:25 am and the flight got cancelled. I rebooked it for 2:15 pm and got to the airport and when it was time for me to board the plane, they cancelled my flight. Totally unprofessional. I would not recommend Southwest Airlines to anyone anymore. No communication at all. Poor poor customer service. 2022 Christmas ruined! Thanks Southwest."
155,"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest cancelled my flight and took it upon themselves to rebook me for another flight scheduled for 3 days later. When I called to request a refund not only was I on hold for almost two hours, I was told that I could only get flight credit. Why should I only get flight credit when I paid for a flight to depart on December 23 and was not given one. Southwest stole my money! I paid for something that was not provided I should be entitled to a full refund given that I did not get what I paid for. What’s to stop Southwest from canceling every one’s flight every day and forcing them to get a credit. I don’t want a credit. I don’t want to ever fly Southwest again. I don’t need a credit. I need my money back since Southwest couldn’t deliver what I paid for. Southwest can’t keep my money. That is stealing!"
156,"Not Verified |  Never fly Southwest! Our aircraft did a weird open seating situation that made boarding a nightmare. No one sat next to each other so stragglers had to squeeze into middle seats, and the flight was delayed by an hour (causing us to miss our connection) because they couldn’t keep track of people coming on and leaving the aircraft. The whole experience with them was worse than any other traveling experiences I’ve had. Don’t fly with them, choose another airline that’s actually organized."
157,Not Verified | We had great boarding positions. Then Southwest changed our flight and we ended up with the last two boarding positions. I wouldn’t care but I was flying with my young daughter. They said I could pay $80 to upgrade if I wanted to guarantee I could sit next to my daughter. Very scary to consider having my daughter sit next to someone else. I reluctantly paid the $80 but will never fly Southwest again. This is one of the main problems with Southwest’s seating model.
158,"✅ Trip Verified | Booked this ticket for myself and my 2 sons. Unfortunately the day before the scheduled departure date I had to change the departure date due to a flu. The change costed $75 each. The following day, just before boarding, one of my sons didn't feel good and had to go back home. I informed the person at the gate that my son was not travelling, gave him is name, (I even noticed he wrote Giovanny instead of Giovanni). Once in Vegas I called Southwest and asked for a credit, but they said that my son's ticket was cancelled due to a no show, they even cancelled the return ticket, therefore my son could not join us. This was a very disappointing experience and I found a serious lack of professionalism with both gate employees and customer service agents. I will not fly again with Southwest!"
159,"Not Verified |  We were booked direct from Bozeman, MT, to Houston, TX, on the same physical plane with the same flight number, but with a brief stop in Denver. We arrived at Denver. No one told us the plane needed maintenance and that we needed to deplane and reboard. We deduced this from the complete deplaning of passengers and, when we asked about the circumstances, were treated by SW employees like complete idiots. We managed to barely make our connecting flight and then board. I sat directly over the baggage loading bay and saw all the transfer bags, which did not include ours. My wife mentioned this to the flight and gate crew. She was, literally, verbally assaulted and told to mind her own business and shut up. Of course, we arrived in Houston without our luggage, which somehow ended up in Dallas. Our luggage finally made it to Houston airport at 2 pm the next day, after which the people contracted to deliver our luggage unloaded it at the wrong hotel. It is 24 hours later, we still haven't got our luggage, comforted only by the knowledge that it is somewhere in Houston, with indeterminate wait times on the phone trying to connect with a human being. Southwest Airlines is a caricature of a budget airline that specializes in cutting corners and offering horrific service."
160,"✅ Trip Verified | The flight was delayed an hour due to flight crew arriving from another flight that was delayed, once everyone was on board, the airline proceeded to make everyone de-board the plane to rescan their boarding passes. How disorganized can one airline be?"
161,"Not Verified |  Due to being very busy last minute I accidentally booked for the wrong airport and didn't realize until I arrived at security. I went to the front desk and Tami was able to help me switch to DCA instead of IAD. I wouldn't have had time to get there to board and my ride had left already so I was so grateful for her assistance! I was able to still get home on time, even a little early."
162,"Not Verified |  My wife and in-laws were flying from Austin TX to Miami Fl. The flight was delayed and left late, they had a connecting flight in Houston that Southwest said would hold. When they arrived the flight was not held. I will never spend another dime to fly Southwest again. They do not do what they say they will do. What they did was disgraceful to their customers. They should be ashamed."
163,Not Verified | They lost a gate checked and tagged stroller and I was mocked by the flight attendant for just wanting my stuff! Their flight crew have attitudes like adult entertainers. Unprofessional. Rude. Should’ve flown Spirit. This review would not be here if the flight attendant did not mock me for trying to find my 4 year old daughters stroller.
164,Not Verified |  I have flown faithfully with Southwest for many years and I’ve never had to cancel a flight. But my boyfriend was ill and didn’t want to expose anyone to whatever he had so we choose to cancel. When we bought our tickets it said in bold print no cancellation fee. And I looked at the small print papers and they also said no cancellation fee will be incurred. When I called to cancel the first person said there is a 200.00 dollar cancellation fee. I asked to speak to a higher person and they told me I have no choice to accept fee or lose all the money. At first I accepted it . Then I read their policy over and over and again it said no cancellation fees. I called back and spoke to someone and said this is not acceptable your policy clearly states no cancellation fees. I had to fight with this person and I told them I will see them in court and call news crews. They finally gave me back my 200.00 dollars. I still have the policy and no fees incurred on my phone. I’m disappointed that they know their policy but yet try to lie and and steal money from their clients. My boyfriend is a lawyer and I’m an educated women and had to fight for my rights. How many people have paid the fee that shouldn’t have. The airline clearly are stealing from people. The public needs to be aware of these deceptive practices. I’m sure they know what they are doing. When I called it was the same person answering and using different names. Shame on him. Shame on Southwest.
165,"Not Verified |  Southwest sucks, and their business class is a scam. You’ll pay $300 extra for no additional service, and every seat on the plane is the same. Not worth doing just buy their regular ticket. After flight cancellation, having to get rebooked on two flights instead of direct one, internet not working, and rude staff refused to offer cash refunds and will only give you a coupon to try to force you to fly with them again."
166,"Not Verified |  I just can't understand why Southwest does not know and does not care to keep your luggage and the items inside dry during a rainy day. It has happened to me twice, unfortunately the day of the flight it has been rainy but Southwest crew have not taken the time and care to keep your luggage and the items inside dry - unbelievable. I have flown with American Airlines on a rainy day and have had no issue, my luggage and items inside have arrived dry. Also, for goodness sake change from first service to assigning seats. Southwest is already charging fees at the same rate other airlines."
167,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst company ever, very unprofessional. They changed us from gate to gate 9 time , after that they cancel the flight, trying to find the flight to get home not helping and very rough people"
168,"Not Verified |  So unorganized as a whole. Delayed flights, short staffed, no drinks. Unassigned seating is so stupid and the seats are tiny. You get what you pay for."
169,Not Verified |  First time flying Southwest and my first time being stranded at the airport - they kept changing my flight times and then canceled it. How can you let people sit at an uncomfortable airport all night with no accommodations at all. Lied about discounts for a room no instructions on how to get to the room or back to the airport in the morning just the flight has been canceled. 
170,"Not Verified |  Terrible experience with zero communication. Passengers understand that weather is out of personal control of the staff, however there should always be a responsibility to communicate when plans must change rather than leaving everyone guessing or to their own devices trying to figure out how they can return home with no options provided. Even if the news is bad it needs to be delivered. We sat on a plane for 5 and 1/2 hours for what was supposed to be a 3 hour flight, then proceeded to land in the wrong city to wait an additional hour on the tarmac, all the while being promised that the plane would be “moving soon.” The only reason this review is not a zero is because I was eventually able to see my checked bag again which I assumed was going to be lost along with all the time I spent waiting to get to my destination."
171,"✅ Trip Verified |  I liked Southwest. We booked the trip during one of their low-fare specials. We didn't experience any delays or boarding issues at all. In fact, we had a total of 4 flights (to and from our destination) and we landed about 20 minutes early for all of them. Flight attendants and gate attendants were friendly. Even the staff at the bag drop was friendly. I really think you receive the ""energy"" you give to people. So I greeted them with a smile and they returned with great customer service. The only thing I will say is that since there aren't different boarding classes, it can be a cramped ride. Two of our flights were booked to capacity, which means there wasn't any extra space or stretching room for your arms or legs. It can be uncomfortable. Still, the inflight movies & snacks helped to ease the ""cramped space"" blues. I would recommend Early-bird check-in to try to get A or B-section boarding--to accommodate your carry-on and seat preference. Some of the travelers in the C section had to check their carry-on luggage at the last minute because the A & B sections used all of the overhead bins. The airlines have a lot of no-hassle policies which I like: 2 free checked bags Free movies & live TV Decent fares Free cancellation and changes I probably wouldn't use the airlines for flights over 2 hours, just because of the seating tightness. I'm 5'4"" and even I found the seats a bit squished for my liking, I felt bad for my 6'0"" husband's knees and back. Other than that, I'll book again for shorter routes."
172,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew from WA to Houston with two toddlers. We arrived in Houston at midnight where the airline told us they had lost our luggage and we’re told to call back at 9am. I told the lady in the front our car/house keys were in that bag and we would be stuck there until our bag arrived. The lady said “ We’ll you can call them at 9am, there’s nothing we can do. I asked to speak to a Southwest Airlines manager at 3:30 10/24 and he said “ that’s why we advice you don’t leave your keys in your bags” . Extremely unhelpful! Will never be flying with Southwest again!"
173,✅ Trip Verified |  I had a horrible experience flying with Southwest this trip. The flight attendant was very rude to us. Being handicap on this flight I would expect more support and help. She yelled at me when I asked her a question. Even the people around us were like you need to settle down. She also wouldn’t get me a wheel chair so my wife had to get it and push me to the baggage claim. I will never fly Southwest again.
174,"Not Verified |  The service clerks at check in were so unorganized. They open service desk at 3:30 am, my flight leaves our board at 5:40 am. Clerks were aggressive with their tone, rude and dry towards customers. We as customers didn’t know we had to use kiosk first. To check in it would help to have someone available to assist us better. Me and my wife will not try to fly here ever."
175,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gate agent became very upset because she insisted I boarded in wrong group. This was not the case and even though i asked for clarification she she called a very rude supervisor who insisted that I could not stay on that flight. Had to rebook with another airline to make my business meeting on time. A very poor way to handle this, she seemed really power hungry."
176,"Not Verified |  I used to be a big fan of SW. That was before they ruined our family vacation and treated us poorly. We were taking our grandchildren to the balloon festival in Albequerque when Southwest cancelled the second leg of our flight and dumped 6 of us in Houston at midnight without even telling us! My grandson saw his bag being pulled off the plane and the flight crew walked out, leaving 6 of us sitting on the plane!! We had to run after them and it was”-so sorry, call back tomorrow!” Yeah “good luck finding a hotel we can’t help”. Five of us were able to get out the next morning, but we missed the last balloon flight of the festival and spent the next day (Sunday) just trying to get home. Oh yeah, we got a $100 voucher per ticket ($400). The hotel we finally found at 1 am cost more than that plus the hotel night we paid for in Albuquerque that we didn’t use. We’ve bought more than 24 airline flights in the last year - not one was on Southwest. We are absolutely disgusted with Southwest and will never fly them again."
177,"Not Verified |  We attempted to book a flight from BWI to Indianapolis for Sunday, October 16, 2022 and wanted to use miles. We were in the process of putting in the information to purchase the ticket and got a notice that we needed to purchase additional miles. We purchased $345 in additional miles to have enough for the ticket and then continued to enter the rest of our information for the ticket. When we clicked purchase, we got an error message and it said to call the airline. Upon speaking with a Southwest Airlines representative, we were told that the flight was now sold out. So frustrating. We then asked for our money back for the miles we could no longer use and were told that they were non-refundable. Apparently Southwest thinks it's ok to spend $345 and not even get a ticket for it. When I asked to speak with a supervisor, I was told that they would forward my ""case"" to Corporate Customer Relations and that we'd hear from them in 10-12 business days. We just received a call from a Customer Relations representative and all he did was explain that he wouldn't refund the money and that it was their policy. The entire process is a bait and switch and should be banned. Southwest Airlines should stop these fraudulent practices and refund customer's money when they can't give them a ticket. We plan to avoid Southwest Airlines whenever we can. Watch out."
178,"✅ Trip Verified |  Still waiting on our luggage. Southwest Airlines is getting on my last nerve. We were told at 4:00 that they located our luggage and once it arrived to Charlotte they would verify that it was our luggage then they would call me and let me know it was there and they would deliver it. Yes, they called and the person asked how long we were going to be here because they didn’t want to deliver it tonight. The girls attitude sucked. we never raised our voice or freaked out. We were polite to every person we spoke to. We went along with everything they said. I don’t know how they misplace every piece of luggage we checked. I could possibly understand one or even two pieces. But all 4? But to call us and give us attitude because they have to deliver it to us. They should have done their job to begin with and deliver it to us at the terminal when they were supposed to then we wouldn’t be in this situation. We are exhausted and fed up with all of it! Southwest Airlines, I’m flying without you next time around."
179,"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest has given affordable flights and continues to so, I enjoy traveling with them. My complaint isn’t the flight itself, its about the boarding. I pay extra to fly business class, so that I can board early and get my pick of seats. Over the past year I’ve sat back and watched more and more people pre boarding. It is obvious that 95% of the pre boarders aren’t disabled, they have just learned the system and are abusing it. All passengers see it and recognize the problem but yet, Southwest has done nothing. My wife flies with me through my campaign pass but she never boards in the same group as I board. We apply for our boarding pass at the same time and she ends up 50 people behind me. When will Southwest fix this problem. I’ve voiced both problems to flight attendants and I’m always told that they are aware of the problem and that they get lots of complaints about it. I’m rating this 5 out of 10 because I’m always upset when boarding. Ruins a portion of the flight every time."
180,"✅ Trip Verified | Decided to purchase early check in hoping for a better seat. It did not clearly explain that you still have to check in later and accept the boarding assignment the choose. When questioned they rudely said ""it does not guarantee A boarding"". I asked since it will not show boarding assignments until normal 24 hours prior to flight how do I know I was give an assignment at 36 hours before flight and was very rudely told that I just didn't understand how it worked but if I wanted to spend some more money I could get an earlier boarding assignment. These are the rudest airline staff I have ever dealt with."
181,"✅ Trip Verified |   couldn't fly because he had to many hours, so we were made to leave the tarmac and go back to the gate. While we waited for over an hour with no air conditioning, nothing about the passengers. Our flight arrived 2 hrs late. I was offered no food or drink the entire time we waited, nor while in the air.  What is wrong with your company and employees? "
182,"✅ Trip Verified |  
This is the worst airline service in The United States by long stretch. This airline has managed to make what should be simple, into a complicated mess with their seating program. If you have to be somewhere on time or if you have to be at an event that is time dependent, do not fly this airline. You will be late and there will be multiple delays or delays then a cancellation following right after. This airline doesn’t cancel early ever, if they cancel a flight, it’s last minute when they calculate it isn’t worth a flight. They do not care if you depended on them, this airline will bend you over with no remorse or second thoughts. This is the airline that will get you to places, but that could mean between 1-3 days after your scheduled flight because of delays and cancellations at the last minute due to not selling enough tickets, but this is how this business conducts its service. Soon enough they’ll be going out of business, and I can’t wait to see this lousy airline become a part of airline bankruptcy history. I will never fly this airline again. I would rather drive or walk to my destination. I am not impressed by this airlines performance. Their service has dropped below its competitors."
183,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have made multiple purchases for a flight and both times the money has gotten put back into my account. The first time I called them and they said it was a banking problem so I called my bank and they said it was nothing on their end, called southwest customer service again after I made my second purchase (which was $100 more then the first time I bought a ticket) and they said everything should be fine, and that the confirmation code was verified and nothing should go wrong. A couple days after wards it happened again so I just called southwest and was on hold for an entire hour just for them to tell me that I need to go to the airport and do it there, I cannot do it online or by any other card and it needs to be purchased at the airport. My flight is suppose to be in a week so there is no guarantees that seats will still be open, I have a job so I can’t go for another 3 days and my airport is almost 2 hours away from me. This is ridiculous, I’m just trying to go visit a friend in college but now I have to deal with this. I have used southwest many other times and had no problems, I thought it was reliable airline but after this, I don’t want to fly with them."
184,"Not Verified |  LAX-RNO. I never seem to have any problems with Southwest and it's been that way for years now. Mind you flying in and out of Reno is always super easy. Check-in at LAX was a breeze as was security. We were kept informed as to the 15–20 minute delay. Both ground staff and cabin crew were just fine. The usual Southwest beverage and snack provided which is fine for a flight under an hour. Flight was quick, smooth and uneventful. Luggage arrived with no hassle and we were on our way home within 20 minutes after landing."
185,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego: Jam packed terminal, absolutely no seating for the entire day. I stood for hours. Multiple delays and two flight re-bookings from 10:55 AM until 6:10 PM in San Diego, when I finally boarded the last flight out of San Diego to Chicago trying to get to Washington DC. I was assured by the gate agent that I would make my connection from Chicago to DC. I missed it by 30 minutes. Arrived at MDW in the middle of the night. No open restaurants in the airport. Took shuttle to expensive hotel, not in my budget, to say the least. No room service. Closed for the night.  No meal vouchers, no compensation offered. Spent $175 for a 5 hour stay. Southwest claimed weather related issues, but other airlines were taking off from San Diego in the fog! Why not Southwest? The truth is, I overheard personnel (flight attendants, gate agents) discussing missing co-workers.  Saying that the delays were weather related let them off the hook for any compensations to abandoned passengers. Flight four of four: Jam packed terminal in Houston, waiting for flight to San Diego. Screaming 3 yr old, screaming 1 year old (same family) in terminal, waiting for our flight. The family (three women) held these screaming children on their laps in the terminal for an hour, never letting them down to walk or run. Then, on the airplane, they sat in the seats behind me. I was in the bulkhead seat, along-side a handicapped man. For the duration of the three hour flight, the young, inexperienced mother did nothing to quiet her children while she read a book.. She gave them no toys, did not talk to them, just let them kick the seats in front of them non-stop, squirt juice onto the head of the handicapped man, all the while letting out non-stop ear-piercing, blood-curdling screams. I have travelled with toddlers before, many times. I know it can be difficult, but this was a parenting issue. The flight attendant was just a few feet away, so could not miss what was going on. The handicapped man asked the flight attendant to intervene multiple times. Only twice, she spoke gently to the mother, who responded ""They are children! What am I supposed to do?"" She was completely unapologetic. The flight attendant never spoke in a firm manner with her, as she should have. I can't help but think that if the screaming kicking person were an adult, the plane would have been landed at the nearest airport and an arrest would have occurred with head -spinning speed. Why is such torture of other passengers tolerated? There was a lot that could have been done to alleviate the situation. Do children's rights trump adult's rights? One of those screaming children did not even pay for a seat, as we adults did. My seat-mate and I agreed that, even though we have both been die-hard Southwest customers for decades (I am 68, and I have been flying on you since you were a baby airline!), we said to each other that we would never again willingly fly Southwest. It has become a cattle-car with none of the humor or comeraderie that used to make it bearable to fly in seats intended to fit middle-schoolers. Bye Southwest."
186,"Not Verified | On Sept 30, 2022, my Southwest flight from Sacrament to Tucson was Cancelled. The computer quickly re-routed me - but on a tedious route with 2 plane changes and long layovers. I approached SW counter staff and they quickly and graciously found a better, more efficient routing. My takeaway from this? I tried to be patient and didn't yell at them. Wonderful results."
187,✅ Trip Verified | Normally Southwest is fine but their communication and timeliness was terrible this last flight. We had an hour delay and then another 45 min delay waiting for a plane that took our gate to empty and board. I guess since we were already late - let us suffer. Very little communication and super frustrating
188,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the worst airline I've ever been on. I have traveled to over 35 countries so I am experienced with most of them. No seating arrangements, are you kidding? I'm not a kid on a school bus anymore! Everyone who thought that's a good idea is just plain stupid."
189,"✅ Trip Verified |  Santa Ana to Portland via San Jose. Our group of 3 persons paid the add on fee of Early Bird for our round trip. Our trip down went as booked. However, Sept 30 we did our online check in (22 hours ahead) and had been assigned A24-25-26 early bird boarding for both legs of our returning flights. Yesterday— Oct 1, 2022 we got to the airport to check in only to find out we had been reassigned to C group on first leg and B group on 2nd leg. At this point we still had NO IDEA our entire itinerary had been changed. I paid an additional $30 fee to upgrade to A7 boarding the other 2 in my group kept their C group. We were all confused and angry. We got down to the gate only to realize we were not even on flight 376 anymore but we were now on a flight 282 to San Jose and our SJC to PDX was also different. So we were no longer on our 4:10pm flight out of Santa Ana to San Jose. We had been moved to a 6:45pm flight because we found out our Portland connection flight had been cancelled. So because they had changed our itinerary at 9am on 10/1 we no longer had A group early bird boarding assigned. We were now stuck in C boarding which was why I had been told I had to pay another $30 upgrade fee so that I would still be in A group. The agent checking us in never even realized what had happened to us. She was very nice but her explanations to us were NOT accurate. She never even told us we were no longer on our 4:10 pm flight. As far as I’m concerned —ALL of this was horrible SW airlines service. We were never consulted on any changes or choices that were made for us. When we did our initial online check in we were in A group for our original reservation flights. When they changed us they did not give us our PrePaid early bird check ins for those new flights. In addition, in reality they should never have changed our first flight either because we could have just had an extended layover of 2 hours in San Jose but still had our pre assigned A group for that portion. I am unhappy and VERY dissatisfied. If they are moving flights they need to be sure they can still honor their own early bird boarding on the flights they are moving their customers to. I am giving them a very low rating because they did not honor the early bird options that our group of 3 had chosen when we made our original reservations and also PAID for. In addition I’m giving the ticket agent a 3 rating because while she was a very nice woman — she should have been able to figure out and tell us that all these changes had been made!! Instead I just paid another $30 for something I had already paid additional for — early check in and A group boarding."
190,"Not Verified |  My parents, husband, and I flew from Maui to Phoenix. My dad is in wheelchair and needs assistance. They said only one of us could accompany him, however since seats are first come first serve it would have split the four of us up. We wanted to be near my parents to help them with anything they needed. They made an exception and let us all go together. This was never an issue with any other airlines. That was really the only hiccup that we had. However Wi-Fi connection was not good for other people that paid for it. Our flight attendants were fantastic, they made the long flight fun! "
191,"Not Verified | I wanted to provide a glowing review for Josey Ventura, Southwest OPS Agent for my 9/11/22 flight from Las Vegas to San Antonio. Josey was amazing! I can't believe what a positive experience she gave my son (3 yrs) and myself. We had been in the airport all day long due to a missed flight (TSA was back-out of the literal door at the airport). Josey was so kind to us, made my son feel welcome and excited to fly, and gave us an incredible experience after a very disappointing and expensive day. She made sure to take care of us so that we were all in-order for our flight and were comfortable and ready to board. I am very grateful for her amazing service and please promote this woman. She needs to represent your company in the upper echelons. She was fantastic!"
192,✅ Trip Verified | Nashville to Philadelphia. This is next to the worst airline I have ever flown. Bizarre. It’s a free for all finding a seat on the plane. No assigned seats. Just get onboard and find a seat - really? It’s low class budget. Employees obviously are not compensated well. Flight attendants are flippant and think they are comedians. They absolutely suck. I routinely fly Delta and opt for AA from time to time but was forced to fly SW due to last minute changes. Flight was delayed waiting for another SW that was late. SW screwed up so now passenger pays the price instead of SW. I cannot say enough bad things. It’s just trashy. Plane looks like it was manufactured in the 70s. No WiFi. No beverages were served because it was “going to be a turbulent flight.” Not a bump was experienced the entire flight. Pay $100 more and fly a real airline that attempts to serve the passenger.
193,"Not Verified |  I have flown Southwest since 1980. Their on time performance is now the laughing stock of the industry. Today my outbound flight is delayed 2 hours. They are delayed well over 50% of the time. In 40 years I was never stranded by them where the delay prevented me making a connection. However, I have been stranded 3 times this year!! I have always been loyal to them, I have kept flying them with hope that they will fix the delays. However, I am now switching to Delta on my next trip. While I don’t fly near as much as earlier in my career, I have spent over $4000 this year with them. No more revenue from me!!"
194,"Not Verified |  On Southwest Flight 1403 from El Paso to Dallas Love Field, we were assisted by the Flight Attendant, Christine, who was really helpful and kind, she helped us get Wheelchair Access at Dallas. It was a tight schedule at DAL and I was worried we wouldn't make it on time, but she was reassuring and that was encouraging."
195,Not Verified |  I had two carry on bags and a cross body bag (literally the size of a wallet) for easy access to my ID. The many scanning tickets literally made me step out of line to “consolidate” my cross body bag into one of my other carryon bags. I paid $30 extra dollars to get priority boarding and this clown basically made me board later (putting me in a position to get a seat farther at the back). I want my $30 back basically because it was a waste of money.
196,"✅ Trip Verified |  They have the absolute worst website and customer service, I tried to upgrade my flight well over 24 prior to my flight on the website and it wouldn't let me upgrade and kept saying error and to call customer so I did and they also had error and were unable to get my flight upgraded, but they ended up charging my account twice. When I called to have them cancel the charges they told me they could do nothing for me and I had to fix their mistakes myself by personally calling bank and have the charges canceled. They did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation, I will never fly Southwest again, the boarding and seating is unorganized and hectic not with the headache."
197,"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest is the worst airline. In March of 2022, they sent my checked bag to a different airport. Now, 5 months later, they sent my checked bag to a different airport again. Terrible customer service: After speaking with several agents about this reoccurring issue, they assured me my bags would arrive 24 hours later. After 48 hours, multiple customer service calls, and multiple false arrival times given to me, my bags finally arrived. Every customer service agent had a different story, and none offered to compensate me for their mistake. I will never fly with this horrendous and overpriced airline again."
198,"✅ Trip Verified |  This airline has completely gone down the drain. Their customer service is practically non-existent, and they think it's ok to cancel multiple flights over multiple days due to ""weather"" ONE HOUR before the flight is to take off, and then not reimburse anything (ubers, change of flight, hotel to stay the extra night). I will be flying any other airline whenever possible. SW has become a disgrace."
199,✅ Trip Verified |  Never flying Southwest again. Family saved about 3-4 rows in the back and made it hard for everyone left to find a seat on a flight they had already oversold. Very stressful experience for my group.
200,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew back home from visiting our daughter in Utah and sat in row 11 in the over the wing exit row. ""Heavenly"" was our flight attendant and she was amazing. From what we heard, she is new to Southwest and we wanted to give her ""Kudos"" for her attitude, knowledge and overall deamenor she had, even with a full flight late in the evening. She was hillarious and should be noted she made dozens of people laugh and enjoy her antics while asking us if we are prepared to help out in the case of an emergency during the flight. We know all to well, reviews can be extremely negative, however, wanted to give a ""shout out"" and A-class service provided by Heavenly and the entire crew of flight 859 at 9:00p Gate B18 in Salt Lake City on 9/19/22. Thank you for making flying fun again."
201,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve always been an advocate for flying with Southwest, but lately I’ve been extremely disappointed with their level of service. The next Spirit Airlines! I’m an A-List preferred flyer based on how frequent I fly, and lately all of my flights have been significantly delayed. I can handle an hour or two, but 4+ hour delays with no alternative solutions is absurd. Be prepared to have back up options to get to your destination when flying with Southwest now."
202,"✅ Trip Verified |  My friend and I were seated a few feet away from the boarding gate since the gate was overcrowded. We were constantly paying attention to any boarding announcements or boarding status displays on the LCD. Other than a 10 min departure delay, there was no other display shown nor any announcements made. When we were close to the departure time, I reached out to the desk to inquire when the boarding would begin. Thats when the LCD showed 'boarding closed' status. There was no personnel at the desk to answer our questions, no boarding announcement made nor any paging calls placed! when we reached our adjacent gate, the associate told us the plane had boarded and was getting ready for departure and that we had missed our flight. All this when we were seated just next to the gate. I had to shell out $450 for another airline ticket to reach my final destination. I have traveled extensively for the past 15 years and have never missed a flight. In this day and age of texts, emails, paging boarding calls, displays and announcements there isn't any opportunity for missing a flight unless the airline doesn't have proper protocol in place to page checked in passengers for boarding. Southwest refused to admit it was their fault. I even showed them a pic of the gate a few min before departure, wondering what's going on with boarding. Both my friend and I could not have missed the boarding call had it been made in the first place. I am not flying Southwest again."
203,"Not Verified |  The Customer Service Representative at Gate 25 whose name was Michelle was extremely helpful when we just barely arrived at the Gate in time for Boarding. She was quick, efficient, and personable and she got us aboard in time. I was duly impressed by her performance."
204,"✅ Trip Verified |  Today we had the pleasure of flying with Southwest. There was a WWII veteran on the plane with us as well that the crew members and the pilot recognized overhead where all other passengers gave a round applause. Once we landed in Wichita, the crew members once again recognized him and stated the fireman were on the sides making a rainbow salute for their appreciation for this sweet man. Yet again, all passengers once again clapped and thanked the veteran. It was one of the best, If not the best experiences I have had on any airline. Thank you Southwest for doing this!"
205,"Not Verified |  Despite a known traveler number being on file, SW consistently fails to print this on the boarding pass - which means we can not go through TSA precheck. I have now wasted over an hour first on the website confirming the number is on file (so can't enter again), on phone calls (on hold, disconnected, on hold again) and through FB messenger attempting to get this sorted out. All I get is an automated system saying someone will be with me shortly - clearly not! - and after eventually getting one response from FB messenger asking for additional information - nothing. Southwest used to be a great airline to travel with: friendly, great customer service, on time. Now, they are awful. Flights delayed or cancelled, no customer service, and the staff cranky - likely because they are overworked and perhaps treated as badly as customers now are"
206,"✅ Trip Verified |  Typical Southwest first excuse for delay was weather, next excuse was air traffic control but all flights at the other gates are departing. They first said 10 minutes delay now an hour. The flight is not full approximately 100 empty seats so they are probably screwing all of us. The 10:00 pm flight which is 4 hours and 10 minutes later"
207,"Not Verified |  2nd time flying with Southwest this year (2022) and both times have been severely disappointed. Between flight cancellations and getting stranded to baggage getting lost and having no answers from the Southwest attendants, by far the worst travel experience through this airline. I usually travel a lot for work and use United which has been great."
208,"✅ Trip Verified |  If you want to get upset, travel with southwest. It is my third flight and the last, with southwest, on the previous trip my bags arrived late but they arrived the same day although late. We gave another vote of confidence to this airline, and it was fatal. Again my bags arrived late but this time the next day, the southwest staff in Fort Lauderdale was very rude, the staff treated all passengers on flight 3920 Fort Lauderdale - Havana as if we had not paid for a decent service. Many passengers came from connections in different cities and even so the Southwest staff forced almost all passengers to pay 75 dollars for the carry on bag, due to this the plane was delayed almost 40 minutes. I felt so bad that I decided not to fly with southwest again. "
209,"✅ Trip Verified | I bought a round trip ticket on Southwest. I was told that bringing my golf clubs in a case would not be a problem. I arrived in Greenville, but my luggage didn't. I had to fill out paperwork and instructions, then go to my destination without any of my needed possessions, including medications. My bags finally arrived and the following day I unpacked my golf carrier, only to discover that Southwest had broken the shaft on my $500 driver. I had to borrow a driver to play the round and cancel other rounds because I couldn't use the same one. I reported the broken driver to Southwest only to be told that they didn't cover the clubs or bag for any loss. I went back and looked at the baggage section on the website and there was no mention of that in the basic policies. Only when digging much deeper was there any information regarding that kind of loss. So in addition to being treated like cattle, squeezed into tiny seats with no legroom, forced to endure 3 plane changes and 4 layovers, I'm out $500 for my favorite driver. I will never use this unprofessional subpar airline again."
210,"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Long Beach. Southwest Airlines employees used to be so friendly and helpful. I guess those days are gone. I was willing to put up with the cattle call seating, delays, and stale pretzels because the treatment was pretty great. The last flight I took began in Long Beach and ended in Las Vegas. I needed additional assistance getting my ticket changed and stood in line for over an hour. Some ""diva"" manager was leaving and left the passengers in the hands of an elderly woman who was clearly new on the job. The diva offered no assistance but flitted in and out of the ticket area while the newbie floundered. Yesterday, I checked on two flights and saw that the return flights on both were not there. In a panic, I quickly made the additional flights. In reviewing my credit card, I saw that I had actually made the round-trip flights. So, I called ""customer service. The CSR who was supposed to be helpful was rude and clearly did not want to take my call. She huffed and tapped her pen and kept saying okay, okay I got it even when I was talking. Then, she proceeded to put in the flights but I still was overcharged. I saw online that my original flights (2) had been canceled and she told me that when a passenger gets new flights their previous ones are canceled."
211,"Not Verified |  We left our home at 2:00 am and arrived at the airport at 4:00 for a 6:00 flight. We checked in and checked our luggage, went through security and approximately 5:15 we were headed for our gate. At 5:22 we received message that our flight had been Modified. Our flight was now at 11:10 and we were not reaching Salt Lake until after 9:00 pm. They said there was nothing they can do! We lost our first day and car rental and would not reach out destination until approximately 2:30 am. This has us up for over 24 hours. Will never use Southwest again."
212,✅ Trip Verified |  I paid extra for my friend and I to sit together. It was an extra $40 for both of us to get seats together. As we boarded the plane people said first come first serve on seats. My friend and I were getting anxious because we feared we were not going to sit next to each other. As it turned out we paid extra and did not sit with each other. We are both very upset about our negative experience and would never fly Southwest again unless our situation can be corrected.
213,"Not Verified |  Our flight got delayed from Chicago to Boston, we were supposed to get hotel because our flight but we didn’t get one - they supposedly said they was sold out, they told us that we can sleep on chairs with our kids in the airport. They were so disrespectful and me and my family had to wait in till late at night to get on a plan we all had to take different flights. I can’t believe this happen to us. I will never fly with them again and I don’t recommend it to anyone."
214,"Not Verified |  I would never fly Southwest again. I understand delays happen, but I am very confident that flights are being cancelled because they are not full enough. I was on the last flight out so it was full. After a 2-1/2 hour delay we boarded the plane. The boarding process is stupid to begin with. They may as well put a numbered tag in our ear and then whack us with a cattle prod when it is our turn. Once on board the plane was stiflingly hot. The seats, which should be called something else because they are not real seats, not for humans any way. Crammed together so tightly that if we were being led to slaughter it would almost be a relief. No Wi-Fi available, you could not hear the pilot when he spoke. If it could be done poorly, it was. The staff was rude, and seemed like they would prefer to be any where but there. What a mess this airline has become. I started flying Southwest back in the 90's and they were fun and hip, and on the ball. Now they are a flying disaster. Never again."
215,Not Verified |  Compliments to Houston Hobby gate staff and especially Miami gate staff for helping us with a disabled grandchild in a wheelchair. I explained to them it would help all if we could go down 3-5 min prior to boarding to load this 11 year old quadriplegic and then fold up her electric portable wheelchair for the gate handlers
216,"✅ Trip Verified |  What a disaster! 8 hours before our flight back to work Southwest cancelled our flight because of bad weather. They auto rebooked us two days later. In what universe is that reasonable option? Spent hours on the phone trying to get our tickets refunded since flight was cancelled. Still working on that. Fortunately United was more professional. While their flights were delayed some, they were able to get us home."
217,✅ Trip Verified |  The staff were super polite. Ricardo Zambria was especially was very friendly. When he found out it was as my first flight with Southwest he wrote me a certificate welcoming me to the southwest family and took a selfie with me. 10/10 customer service. I will definitely be flying with them again!
218,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst flight I have ever been on. Southwest Airlines are really making it not pleasant to fly, seats are on top of each other, packed to the brim. No one is happy! I will never fly Southwest again. It seems completely irresponsible to me that an airline does not have a policy for overweight. I have the worst experience in a recent trip to Boston. I am not against obese people, just seems irresponsible that if you know how uncomfortable I was, the response is sorry ma’am there is nothing it can be done. I was next to the window. This person took the middle seat. He was taking my personal space because of the size. Whenever he needs to move, he was pushing my body against the window. At some point my right side was completely numb and my back was in pain. If I need to move, I was unable because I did not have enough space to move my legs nor my body. Several times I have had to push him to the side, but again, he barely fits in the seat. I was completely uncomfortable with him pushing and touching of this person. It was horrible! Southwest Airlines must allow that if someone is overweight, then allow this person to have the seat next to him/her empty. That way we are all happy and comfortable. I know he was uncomfortable too, but please be considerate with your passengers."
219,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest lost my bag. I am not upset they lost my bag - as stuff happens. I am upset with the follow up and follow thru of Southwest staff to return my bag to me. And how the Southwest agent misinformed me on the policy for purchases and reimbursement. Your agent told me “get whatever you need and we will be able to cut a check for you for pickup, after receipts are provided.” Yep - that is not the Southwest protocol. I asked manager at the DesMoines terminal to train and educate her staff so other passengers aren’t misinformed down the line. She did not respond. We traveled to Iowa for a wedding, my bag had my clothes as well as clothes for my 2 year old daughters (who was a flower girl in the wedding). Upon arrival with no bag, the nice gal at the Southwest counter said it will be here late tonight, and to call before coming in case the flight was delayed. I called at 4am the following morning (as that’s when she said was the next opening of the office) and my bag hadn’t moved from my original departure location. I called 4 more times that day, to be told different stories each time about how they would get my back to DesMoines, or that is was just sitting and they couldn’t tell what was going on until the bag was scanned in again. It almost seemed like once the bag is lost, there isn’t really a person who ensures it gets back on a flight to the final destination. The agents could only tell me where it was sitting. No bag delivered Saturday night. Bag finally delivered Sunday morning. Upon arrival, the nice gal at the counter gave me my bag and told my to come by after 1pm and they will have a check ready. She even scanned in my receipts. Came by after 1pm and she explained to me that I had to email the Southwest Manager at the DesMoines airport for details on how to submit the claim.  I just spend the better part of $800 and now you explain to me that I have to submit a claim and wait 30-45 days. I would not be upset if she informed me of the correct process on the front end. All I ask for is better training. Southwest - you can do it!"
220,"Not Verified |  Stewards were horrible. They literally threw the nuts at us, were not happy to take our trash away. Never a smile or friendly face. It sure seemed like they did not want to be there. When we boarded there was a nice gentleman that did greet us. Worst flight I have ever been on. Airlines are really making it not pleasant to fly, seats are on top of each other, packed to the brim. No one is happy! I will never fly Southwest again."
221,"✅ Trip Verified |  My grandson and I were supposed to leave Juan Santamaria Airport in San Jose, Costa Rica en route to Baltimore at 1:05 p.m. on Saturday, August 13. The flight had six delays and did not depart until after 7:00 p.m. The passengers were told that the scheduled pilot had flown too many hours within some specified time, and was over FAA regulations. Another pilot needed to be found. In addition, they said there were ""some problems in Baltimore"" without specifying what. I will note there are a lot of problems in Baltimore. It seems completely irresponsible to me that an airline would not keep track of pilot hours flown in order to avoid putting their customer through the situation we experienced. Before we boarded we were informed that our flight would not be non-stop, which is what we paid for. The reason given was that be the time we reached Baltimore the customs agents would have quit work for the day. We were rerouted through Houston, which added another two hours to our total flying time. When we arrived in Houston we had to drag our carry-ons out of the plane at 11:00 p.m. to have them clear customs--over three hours after we were to have landed in Baltimore--then lug them back onto the plane. Our flight finally touched down in Baltimore around 4:00 a.m., over eight hours later than the scheduled 7:45 p.m. arrival of the previous day. At least my grandson and I could go home. Many travelers were transferring in Baltimore to other destinations. For them, the agony of the day only continued. I will add that our check-in to go to Costa Rica on Saturday, August 6 did not go well either. The line at the international check-in was over one-eighth of a mile long! I have photos to prove it. Southwest did not have sufficient agents to accommodate the customers on the international flights they had booked. They were grossly understaffed. It was only through the intercession of an agent that my grandson and I were able to make our departing flight. Southwest offered the passengers on our returning flight a $200 coupon good for another Southwest flight within the next year. Big deal! We paid $1,000 round trip, $500 each way. If they really wanted to make amends they would have had a rebate commensurate with the frustration they heaped upon their customers. When Southwest arrived on the national scene years ago as a regional airline which was expanding I was very impressed. They can blame their current problems encountered by me, my grandson, and all the other customers on COVID, not enough employees, supply-chain issues, or whatever other excuses are in vogue these days. It is clear to me that this company has devolved to a significant degree. They have lost the customer-orientation they once had. Not being able to add the hours a pilot flies, and not being able to compute how many check-in people are needed for the departing flights are issues of poor management. Very poor! I will be looking for other carriers for my future trips to Costa Rica, and suggest to all who read this not to fly Southwest until such time that they give evidence of better management ... like being able to add and divide. "
222,"✅ Trip Verified |  My brother and I were flying into Denver (round trip) and were going to take a second flight into Colorado Springs. We were supposed to meet up with our two sisters who were also taking flights into Denver, but not the Springs. When we were getting ready to board our flight to the Springs, we realized it was more efficient to meet up with our sisters at the Denver airport, so we went up to customer service to explain what we wanted to do. The lady at the desk told us that if we didn’t take our flight to Colorado Springs, we would forfeit our return flight. so we said “oh never mind, we will take our flight to Colorado Springs, we don’t want to forfeit the return flight.” but the lady insisted she would help us and cancel the in between flight, and assured us that we would be able to return home. no problem. now, we came to the Springs for our return flight and my itinerary did not come up, while so my brother was able to check in no problem. the lady at the front desk told me that i had forfeited my flight when i came into Denver, even though the woman who we talked to in Denver about it said she was taking care of us. I had to purchase my ticket again for the return flight while my brother had no problem with his return flight. "
223,"✅ Trip Verified |  We arrive early to find out the 8:55pm flight is delayed nearly hours. I have my pregnant wife and 2 year old daughter sitting at the airport at 11pm only to find out the plane we are waiting for hasn't left Los Angeles yet and to expect more delays. I know it's not profitable but warm up another plane, wake up a local crew and get these people moving. You should see this terminal right now ... people are frustrated and look defeated."
224,"✅ Trip Verified |  Got notified at 10am by email an hour before the flight leaves stating that flight will be canceled and I was rebooked for 3pm flight. My flight was supposed to land at 6pm in Dallas, now if I take the flight at 3pm I won't land til 12am. I have a 10 year old and he has school the next morning. Southwest has no moral or respect for their customers. They want us to arrive early and be prepared but they don't. They can over book flights and canceled them with no repercussions but when we do something such as canceling our flights they won't refund us back our money."
225,✅ Trip Verified |  I arrived 2 hours early for my flight home for my mother in laws memorial service only to be told that my flight has now been delayed by 4 hours so now I'm sitting at the airport from a flight that was supposed to leave at 8:15 AM now not leaving until 12:10 PM. I'm sitting at the airport for 6 hours only to be told that my flight was delayed due to a mechanical issue then I was told that it was due to Weather. I don't appreciate being lied to. I was offered a raggedy $200 love voucher which did nothing for me With my flight being delayed by 4 hours. I missed the service in addition to having to change my rental car pick up time. My return flight home with my partner was delayed again again only to be told that that it was weather but we were pushed back for over an hour and a 1/2. I called Southwest spoke to a representative who told me that corporate would be calling me gave me a confirmation number but I have yet to hear from anyone about about this issue.
226,"Not Verified |  Fantastic service and friendliness - above average experience. Singing on the microphone, making jokes to ease nervous passengers, no sarcasm just positive humor, just world class service! snacks are sub par but i brought some of my own!"
227,"Not Verified |  I appreciate almost everything about Southwest Airlines: their friendly staff members, their free check bags, and even their customer service agents. But what really brings my review in today is a frustration that really ruined the experience altogether. After an anticipated flight home they texted to report that they had canceled our flight, with very short notice. They then rebooked us for another flight with 7+ hrs of airtime. Traveling with an infant makes that possibility near disaster. When I tried to call and rebook (the customer service gal was very courteous, but there wasn’t much she could do) every other flight was significantly longer in airtime or wasn’t until weeks out (since all the more direct flights had been sold out probably months ago). I would like Southwest to consider how this effects the people of whom they claim to care for. The short notice on cancelation left us no choice but to bite the bullet and pay a more expensive ticket on another airline (since its booking a day before) or waste time that could have been spent with the family we were hoping to see and take the longer more miserable travel route. I’m not sure on the reason for the cancelation but a promise/commitment to provide a service should mean something, especially when you pay for it! It would be nice if they would follow through. Regardless of the fact that they may lose a little money by flying a plane that doesn’t get sold out. If the cancelation was for other reasons not related to business or money, I may understand. If that is the case this review can be disregarded."
228,Not Verified |  Southwest flight 4790 just packed us all on this plane like sardines and then missed their departure window because there was too many people to board. Now we are all sitting here stuck on a plane that can not be wheels up for over an hour. We were told not to leave the aircraft but that the doors would be left open only for legal purposes. It's hot as heck and super stuffy in here. No water has be offered. This feels wrong. You can't treat human beings like this.
229,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the worst flying experience I have ever had. They were short staffed with pilots so they cancelled the Austin leg of our flight because of the time constraints we were forced to spend 24 hours at the airport and after three failed attempts to put on standby flights and showing no empathy I finally got on a flight to Vegas with my wife and two kids one of them 6 years old. He is emotionally scared now from the frustration, also when we arrived in Vegas they switched our baggage claim 3 times. "
230,"✅ Trip Verified | We arrived at 9.15am for a flight that was to be boarding at 10. When we arrived the flight was delayed to 10.50am due to unknown reason. Once we had arrived to Baltimore we had a 4 hour layover which had turned into a 3 hour layover because of our delay at the previous airport. Southwest also makes you board in assigned numbers, but doesn’t give you assigned seats so every man/woman for themselves. They then delayed that flight back another 2 hours due to weather which had not even arrived in the area yet. When we had finally boarded the plane we began again to wait while the 3 flight attendants made jokes and conversed when they should’ve been making sure we are ready for take-off. They then introduced a new flight attendant and rode around the runway for no reason which takes more time away from our travel. After that we waited again as they delayed the flight for weather purposes. While we were delayed while sitting in the plane they attempted to try and take us back to the airport to let us off the plane and we were told they couldn’t because the boarding terminal wasn’t set up so we’ve been sitting in the plane and the airport for hours. Weather has been great all day until 5-6 pm, I’m so confused on how we have not arrived to our destination but yet my arrival time says 5pm and yet it’s 6.30pm and I still have yet to leave the airport! Ridiculous service."
231,"✅ Trip Verified | There were several delays. My flight was scheduled to leave at 10.25 pm then 11.00 pm, a few more delays and then cancelled around midnight. No vouchers were offered. I had to find my own hotel and was rebooked on a flight the next day at 10.25 pm. Now I’m sitting at the Phoenix airport and and after a few more delays I just received a text stating the flight is again delayed until 12.37 am. Worst customer service ever. One of the customer service reps told me the one hour delay was because they were holding the flight for a few passengers. An hour delay for a few passengers? Not likely. Last night we were told they were waiting on a crew member. Today they told me yesterday‘s flight was cancelled because of weather. This airline needs to stop lying to their customers. The also don’t have an agreement with other airlines so they won’t get anyone a flight with another carrier. Don’t use Southwest if you need to be anywhere important."
232,✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest is the worst airline I have seen lately my 7:00 pm flight is now delayed till 11:45 pm. I took a walk down the concourse every single gate 22 of them are delayed by at least 1:5 hours. The gate agent trying to tell me it’s the weather so apparently bad weather compassing the entire US for about 4 hours.
233,"✅ Trip Verified |  The second leg of my daughter's return flight to MSP was cancelled. SW could only offer a replacement flight the next day. She would have to spend a night in Baltimore rather than flying on to Minneapolis as scheduled. The SW agent directed her to work it out with another airline, but a Delta supervisor explained that Southwest doesn't participate in a reciprocal arrangement with any other airline. My daughter was forced to buy a Delta ticket at double the cost of the original Southwest flight in order to get home the same day. I meanwhile ran back to the SW counter to get a refund. Supposedly SW will refund the cost of the cancelled flight (half the replacement cost) but I haven’t seen that yet. Desired outcome (optional) For all the inconvenience, stress, and extra cost, SW, at minimum, needs to make reimbursement of the full cost of the replacement flight"
234,"✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Dallas. My sister and I were returning to Dallas. There had been some delays or flight changes. We checked in separately. When the staff discovered what was going on with our flight, YALL, he RAN to get my sister’s bag from the console so he could place us on the same flight (avoiding the delay). He was so kind and didn’t have to do that. I have NEVER had a rep RUN to assist me, that’s called customer service. Later, a pleasant young lady educated me on the Clear check in as an option to have for quicker future travel. I love Southwest!"
235,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight was delayed about 3 hours and we didn’t leave Orlando until after 1am… not the end of the world but there were no representatives giving us any updates on the status of our flight but just a gate monitor showing our flight getting more and more delayed which was kind of frustrating. It would have been nice to see better communication from Southwest employees so I knew why the plane was delayed and if I should expect it to be cancelled or not. At one point during my long wait at the gate, they started boarding another flight that wasn’t supposed to leave until 2 hours after ours so that was frustrating as well. I just felt like my flight was forgotten about until 1am. On the bright side, I got into the A boarding group without paying extra for reserved check-in despite it being a full flight. The crew was very nice, the seats were fairly comfortable, and I got a variety of free snacks as well as a free drink. Entertainment was available on the Southwest app and WiFi was available for purchase. If it weren’t for the lack of communication and delay, I would give Southwest 10/10. I would recommend them as long as you book a flight that isn’t at night because it will most likely get delayed due to summer thunderstorms or staffing shortages and you may not get home until the following day."
236,"Not Verified | Atlanta to La Guardia. On Monday, July 25th, 2022, my daughter and I were returning home from Atlanta to NYC (LaGuardia) via Southwest Airlines. First time ever using them. We arrive at the airport at 4AM for a 6:10AM flight. After going through TSA and sitting at the gate for a while, our flight was cancelled with no announcement or warning. My daughter happened to look up and see on the gate TV screen the words “CANCELLED”. The gate personnel were gone and I was left to 1) calm my daughter’s nerves because she has never experienced this before 2) calm my own nerves as I suffered from severe anxiety and my meds were in my checked bag and 3) try to figure out what to do next. Keep in mind, I booked the early morning flight because I had to be home by 9:30am to take over the babysitting duties of my two other children so that my wife could go to work. So that was my first thing to address, finding last minute child care. I then get an email confirming that my flight was indeed cancelled (no explanation as to why) and I was put on the 8:25 PM plane to LGA later that night. So now the next steps were to find out what happened to our checked bags and what to do for 14 hours till my flight with pretty much no money left for my daughter and I to find a hotel (I mean we’re taking a low budget airline. I’m a stay-at-home dad living on my wife’s income. Go figure). 14 hours later with our bags in NY before we are even on a plane, we get to the departing gate for our rescheduled 8:25pm flight and of course it’s DELAYED. 9:10pm is the new departure time. Then it’s pushed back to 10PM!!! Once on the plane, only water and a snack was offered to us (soda, coffee and alcohol were no longer an option). Once at LaGuardia, we then had to find our checked bags. My pre-arranged airport pick-up, no longer available. The line for a taxi, extremely long. My daughter and I jumped on a city bus to take us to Manhattan so that we could take a taxi to the Bronx. $30 dollars I couldn’t afford to spend charged to my credit card. Long story short, got to the airport at 4AM and after an anxiety inducing day/afternoon, my daughter and I get home at 2am in the morning. Fast forward to today. I call Southwest customer service to 1) get an explanation and 2) find out how Southwest can make things right for me so that I can continue using them in the future (again, this was my first ever experience with them). The agent informed me that the first flight was canceled due to weather and that the rescheduled flight was delayed due to air traffic control issues, so we were not entitled to compensation. 1) I never once said on the call I wanted to be compensated so that was quite an assumption and 2) was then told after reiterating everything I went through “would you have preferred that we put you on an unsafe flight?” I mean WOW!!!!! What a “great” condescending customer service response. To the Southwest rep that hopefully reads this (and yes, I will be posting this on MULTIPLE review sites and social media), I shall NEVER fly Southwest again and will voice my displeasure to anyone who asks me about my experience with Southwest. PS- My family and I had an issue with JetBlue a few years ago and their customer service was the TOTAL OPPOSITE of what I experienced with Southwest. Very warm, helpful and their actions showed that I was a valued customer."
237,✅ Trip Verified |  Second flight couldn't be bothered to wait 10 minutes due to my plane having mechanical issues. Got stranded in Denver for the night. They wouldn't let me get my bag even though I had my cat with me. Lost my bag and sent it to Las Vegas. All I got was $400 in travel vouchers which are worthless to me since I would never travel with this horrible airline again. I was told lie after lie about what needs to be done and was given the runaround for hours. 
238,Not Verified |  Good prices and nice perk with the free checked bag. I’ve flown Southwest multiple times solely because of price and you get what you pay for. I never had a flight from Southwest on schedule. Always a delay or changing gates last minute. Seats are uncomfortable and most of the time the staff is rude. One time they “couldn’t find the pilot” and delayed us for three hours. I recommend spending the extra money and flying with another airline. Southwest is very unprofessional
239,✅ Trip Verified |  I am a military active duty member. All other airlines allow active duty members to board with class A or first. I was not able to board the flight until everyone from class A boarded first.
240,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest left us stranded in Amarillo for 2 days. We finally had to buy United Airline tickets $1,200 to get back home. Southwest offered us $175 refund Southwest is so disappointing. Don’t let their prices fool you. You get what you pay for. Totally unreliable"
241,"Not Verified |  Bad deceptive customer service. Used a travel fund of $20 from a previous flight against a new flight. Paid an additional $150. One day later got covid and had to cancel. But the entire $170 credit now has an expiration date of just a few days - because the old original $20 travel fund would have expired in just a few days. That's not right. The $150 I just paid should have a new expiration date, and not be stuck with the old. Called customer service. She wouldn't budge. It's my problem, I suppose. Shame on you Southwest."
242,"Not Verified |  Tried to get a nonstop, cancelled that months ago. Cancelled my connecting flight while I was in the air, rerouted with another connection. Every flight delayed due to weather or crew availability. Left home at 7am arrived destination 1am for what should have been a 2.5 hour flight. Lost the bags, took another 24 hours to get bags from when they went missing. We really appreciated the tag on the bag saying sorry for the inconvenience. I work hard for a living, 5 day vacation, Southwest stole 2 days of them. if you are understaffed don't continue to book flights. I will understand that and drive next time."
243,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Orlando. I booked a flight for my family of 9 to depart on June 29 at 9am and when we get to the airport awaiting to be boarded, they announced the flight is canceled at 8:30am. A few minutes later, they arranged the passengers to either call or wait in line to the customer counter to have flight rearrange. The reason that was given the flight was cancelled is that weather in Orlando is bad enough for they now allowing flights to come in (which is a super stupid and big lie). And it was just that I searched the internet to see that over 1000 of their pilots are picketing and I believe this is the true reason and they just not willing to admit that and unwilling to cut low on their flights to accommodate this. Instead, my flight is delayed for almost 12 hrs and my family of 9 had to split up with 3 flying to transfer in Ohio. We ended up to arrive in Orlando at 1 in the morning instead of 1 in the afternoon. And I see that a flight on the same day departing at 10 am did not have a delay or cancellation. This is the first time I fly in Southwest and probably the last time. I accept delay but I do not accept giving unbelievable excuses due to the company’s poor management and their attitude to just want to make money and carelessness for people whatsoever."
244,"Not Verified |  Horrible customer service. Looked online last night having to go out of town for celebration of life for my father-in-law. Flight is $1200 for myself, husband, and 2 year old. Called to see if we could get discount for bereavement. Was transfered over to the manager, he quoted me that it was going to be over $2000. I asked why so much as it's still showing $1200 online. Said that's what he's able to give. I asked to speak to a manager about getting discount. Said he was the manager, asked to speak to his manager. Said he was the only manager.  Then told to just buy it online and then have a nice day. Then he hung up on me. Never, have I ever spoke to someone so arrogant and rude."
245,"Not Verified |  Southwest post COVID is a complete disappointment. They were known for customer service and were the last to come to the party with positive customer service and drink service after the pandemic. It is clear that morale among flight attendants is low - not sure if that is due to corporate support or employee entitlement after COVID. I have switched to Delta and United for all business travel and now fly SW only for price necessity. I was a very loyal customer for years and now feel no loyalty at all. Prices are not worth it. Late flights, SW waits too long for delayed passengers - how does it make sense to hold up 200 (ish) passengers for 5 people? I have been on both sides and would have understood if flight had to leave. Today we waited 45 minutes for 5 passengers, all of whom boarded in the first 30 minutes. Why the extra 15 min? Previously delightful attendants now act put out and entitled. Prices aren’t as competitive as they were historically. What a shame - used to be such a great company."
246,"Not Verified |  Unfortunately, a friend was not able to make a flight that I had purchased for them. Since I was in the middle of a flight myself, I could not cancel the flight. Southwest enacted their no show policy. Therefore, no refund could be given for the initial missed fight nor the return trip. The overall cost was +$600. I can understand penalizing me for the initial flight, but to take the funds for the return flight is downright criminal. I was given a travel voucher for only $150. I have noticed that in the past few months that the customer service at Southwest has dramatically declined. I have tried to contact them several times concerning this issue. I only receive a generic reply email stating the no-show policy and a half-hearted sorry. I would say that if you plan flying with them to at least check other options."
247,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’m currently sitting in the Houston Hobby airport fighting back tears of anger and frustration. Southwest should be ashamed of themselves but they are not. We landed from Harlingen at 9:04pm getting alerts that our flight home to St. Louis was delayed the minute airplane mode went off. Currently our flight home is a play pretend flight; as of this very moment the departure is scheduled for 2:19am and originally that departure was 9:55pm. We have no real scheduled flight home because the departure time is constantly being moved, the excuse is MCO weather bc that is the connecting flight however the gate next to ours is on time and flying into MCO, Southwest has no responsibility in the matter or to make anything right bc it’s “the weather’s fault”? I’m so disappointed. I exclusively fly Southwest. Say nice things (until now). Encourage and book trips that make y’all a lot of money. Even had one booked for 2 weeks from now that thanks to your lack of accountability I have plenty of time to cancel sitting in your airport waiting for my play pretend flight. The icing on the cake? Myself and my travel partner were offered a flight out in the morning if we chose to pay for our own accommodations due to the lack of accountability or give a damn by Southwest.  Get your life together Southwest, you just lost a life long traveler on your airline but based on how you do things you obviously don’t care in the least."
248,"Not Verified |  3 hours before my flight they canceled it and booked it 15 hours later. I was forced to use another PTO day of work so now I’m down a PTO day because of them. I would rather walk from Boston to Denver than fly with them again. The last two times I flew with them, they put my luggage on the wrong flight and they delay every flight."
249,"✅ Trip Verified |  Out of the three different airlines I’ve flown with in the past couple of months, Southwest is by far the best. I’m not sure I would have thought that pre-pandemic, but they seem to have weathered the storm a little better than the others. The plane was cleaner, the attendants were nice and relaxed and the service was also superior to what I experienced with the others."
250,"Not Verified |  Constantly reschedules your flights, doesn't go anywhere direct and every flight is delayed. They pack planes way too full with no room and are always running late. Switching to a different airline after all the horrible experiences I've had."
251,"✅ Trip Verified | I am tall to the point where I need special accommodation for seats, because of this I was a little worried when my family bought seats with Southwest, as they don't have a business class. Fortunately (I thought) a nice lady at the gate upgraded me to pre board. I had bought early boarding before and I thought this was an upgrade. Unfortunately the front row seats had gotten taken by the elderly and children, so I went back to exit row seats. With pre board you are not allowed to sit in the exit row though. While I appreciate the gate lady that ""upgraded"" me the flight attendants were rude about it and people that should have boarded after me anyways got the seats with enough leg room while my knees got embossed with the arm rests of the seats in front of me. I have canceled my return tickets and am spending hundreds of extra dollars to never fly with Southwest again."
252,"✅ Trip Verified | Horrible, terrible, poor customer service. Unaccountability, inconsiderate, nothing but issues from the beginning to the end and more. They made me miss my flight, re-booked me, sent my luggage to the wrong location and charged me to get my luggage delivered."
253,"Not Verified |  Plane was to depart at 4:00 PM. Flight was delayed then cancelled. Agents would not assist with rebooking, hotel accommodations, or anything else. Five adults and two children were left to fend for themselves. After talking with another agent a flight was found with seats at an airport over 30 miles away. Southwest did book us on the flight but offered no assistance in securing ground transportation. We had to use Uber (2) which we paid ourselves. We paid Southwest for priority seating and got boarding numbers B-20, and B-21. These numbers were not sufficient to be worth the extra charge. If Southwest can't promise boarding in A group they should not charge."
254,"Not Verified |  In November of 2021, I flew Southwest Airlines to visit my family in Oklahoma City. Purchased EarlyBird check-in and had an A46 boarding position. We had a layover in Phoenix after flying in from San Diego, and our flight to OKC got delayed by about 2 hours, with our original 7 PM departure time being delayed to 9 PM. Talked to the gate agent and she said the delay was caused by our aircraft being delayed in Baltimore. Our aircraft had SWA's older Evolve cabin. I got about an hour of sleep before arriving in OKC. On the return trip, we flew to Denver where our plane had the newer Heart interior. The plane to San Diego had the Evolve cabin again. There was no delay, and we ended up getting back home to San Diego safely. Honestly, I like Southwest for their low fares and open seating."
255,"✅ Trip Verified |  Changed gates, delays, took 3 hours sitting on the plane. The only thing they told us that they were waiting on paperwork. I suggest flying on another airline. Even Frontier treats its customers better."
256,"Not Verified |  I flew my son home with Southwest from college for spring break. During the stay we were notified that his flight had been cancelled. I immediately emailed and called and actually since we could not find a return flight under 1000 on a one day notice , I waited on hold 7 hours (I can prove this). Not only did no one answer, no one has answered my numerous emails. Since that time I canceled my Southwest cc and refuse to ever endorse or recommend them I am reaching out to see what sort of legal recourse I have."
257,"✅ Trip Verified |  What a scam airline. Everyone should know this scam they are pulling while bragging about no bag fees. This is there only selling point. They know they would lose 50% of their customers overnight if they started bag fees. There check in procedure is set up to make you want to use your points to upgrade. I was waiting to check in with my laptop and phone through there own app. Conveniently enough, when 24 hour check time came up, the website and app took 3 minutes to come up with the check in button. By the time it did and I was able to hit check in, I was given end of B group. I immediately called southwest to find out what was wrong with there system. The lady said nothing was wrong, BUT, we can upgrade you for 25,000 points to put you in A 1-15. I jumped on it because I want to use my points up and will never fly southwest again. Will cancel my credit card that I have had since 04 and spend extra money for peace of mind travel, not games. Very unprofessional business practices."
258,Not Verified |  Paid for Early Bird Check-in and was still B34 (94 people plus families with kids ahead of me). Was told by agent it doesn't guarantee a better boarding number and that it was better than having a C boarding. My husband was only a couple of numbers behind me and we didn't pay for Early Bird for him. Wondering what I'm actually paying for if not a better place in line so I could get an isle seat. The flight was totally full so I got stuck in the middle. Only one of 3 flight attendants was friendly. Not a great flight!!
259,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid for earlier bird special 80 bucks to get a boarding number of B 38 great value. Flight was canceled had to leave 4 hours later. I talked with an agent at the counter only to catch attitude. Personally I’m only flying Southwest because the were the cheapest. Like the old saying goes you get what you pay for. PS I was suppose to get a call back in 15 minutes, it’s been over a day now and still no call."
260,"✅ Trip Verified |  My children were set to fly today with their grandparents for a nice trip to Florida, as school and daycare are not covered this week, it seemed like a win win, until Southwest got involved. I took them to the airport and Southwest cancelled last minute with no flights leaving to the destination for 3 days. Somehow though, the checked bags are all flying to the original destination but with no passengers, so what is going on? We asked and they cant answer. Southwest claims weather and therefore wont refund the ticket price but yet the bags are flying there right now? So what is going? But they claim weather and wont discuss refunds or credits. You ruined their vacation, screwed us on daycare this week and there is important medication on those bags not to mention my kids clothes but we wont get them back for three day plus according to Southwest. Unbelievable. I used to fly west Southwest for all of my work travel but I will never fly Southwest again for business or pleasure. Get your act together Southwest, this is completely unacceptable."
261,"✅ Trip Verified | Sarasota to Denver. Flew on 061922 with two children from Denver to Sarasota, with a layover in Indianapolis. Flew back on the 25th with a layover in Dallas. On the way there I got a text message from Southwest that my flight had been delayed by hours. Luckily I was in the airport when I got the message and could determine the flight had been delayed, but by less than an hour. Gate attendants were unable to explain the reason for the incorrect message. Flying back, I got another text before leaving for the airport that the flight was delayed by hours. I checked the website and found this was another incorrect message from Southwest and the delay was again less than an hour. I found other customer reviews indicating many others had received similar text messages from Southwest and the inconvenience and expense for some had been significant. There were enough reviews that Southwest had to be aware of the problem for some time and had not fixed it. I’ll be doing everything I can to avoid flying Southwest in the future."
262,"Not Verified |  Very disappointed with Southwest Airlines! The original flight was canceled approximately 2 hours before flight. Family was traveling to the airport causing lost time, expenses, and confusion. No other flight were available. After almost an hour delay the airline finally answered the phone. A wasted 2 hour trip to the airport only to turn around and drive home. Flight was rescheduled 1 week later and early bird check in was dropped. Unbelievable hassle. Not to mention the loss of time spent with my son, who visits just a few weeks a year."
263,"✅ Trip Verified |  Currently ongoing. Typically have recommended this airline, but this has been a horrible experience. Our flight from STL to Portland, ME had our connecting flight in Baltimore canceled. Customer service was horrid and had to eat money on 2 hotel rooms for that night; the impromptu one and the originally scheduled one. Lost a full 24 hours waiting on the flight we got rebooked for. On the rebooked flight, we paid extra for A-boarding, but due to their system issue or something their personnel forgot to do in the computer with pur luggage, we got kicked out of line and had to go to customer service; nothing about us getting refunded that money. Now, flying back from Portland via Chicago to STL, showed up to airport and flight immediately delayed 2 hours. As plane touched down and getting ready to board, announced another 45 minute delay due to ""weather."" Checked weather in Chicago: beautiful. Weather here: beautiful. Weather in-between: nothing. It's all staff, but they're walking all over their customers using Weather as an excuse to keep from compensating anyone."
264,"Not Verified |  As my departure time neared, I received several messages over the course of 2 hours. Each indicating an additional delay. This now meant I had no hope of making my connecting flight. I called to reschedule for the next possible flights to my destination. After waiting a half hour on hold, I explained my situation to a human, and was asked to be put on hold while he found me another flight. As I had already looked up possible flight schedules, I thought this would be a quick hold, as there were very few possibilities. After 40 minutes on hold, I was hung up on. Now, I have to call back. This time it only took 15 minutes to get a human, so I should consider myself lucky, right? I explained everything over again, and apologized if I sounded irate (which I was). This time, I just told the woman which flight I wanted. I then inquired about what she could do to make me feel better about flying Southwest, ever again in the future. I suggested a simple upgrade to 'A' on my boarding pass, to get me on the plane earlier, so I might get a window seat. This would have cost the airline nothing, and would have made me feel like they were actually sorry about my being quite inconvenienced. She said she couldn't do that, but could give me a discount on my next flight (which would cost them). I told her I didn't want a coupon for a flight I might never take, and she asked if I'd like to speak to someone about it. I said that I would like to speak with a supervisor, and was about to insist on not being put on hold, when...I was put on hold. I'm not one to give up easily, so I waited on hold... for an hour and a half, before I was forced to hang up because I had to leave home for my new flight at 3am, and it was almost 11pm. Now I'm going to be late for an appointment at my destination and get only 4 hours of sleep. I have great respect for Southwest flight personnel, but their customer service absolutely awful! And, I'm unlikely to fly with them again, because of that."
265,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest Airlines is a nightmare. I have never encountered airline staff so horrific in my lifetime. When we arrived at our gate to board 10 minutes early, they yelled at us to haul our butts on board and that we were “late”. Except they failed to tell us that our actual flight was at another gate, instead, all 3 staff members yelled that we were on a different flight and how dare we try to board this one…except this was the gate and time our tickets stated. They refused to even look at our tickets to find out which gate they moved our flight to. After 10 minutes of sitting feeling confused, I went back up to them and asked where we were supposed to board our flight that our tickets said was boarding at that time and that exact gate we were waiting at. The guy sheepishly realized that they just about caused us to miss our flight which had been moved 10 gates down…instead of letting us know right away, they shamed us for following the information on our tickets and demanded we get out of their faces. Unbelievable."
266,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest Airlines took $3,650.76 on May 27,2022 and refused to refund my money for a flight that they had cancel due to inclement weather on that date. That same very date of May 27,2022, Southwest had rescheduled my flight to board a 5:50am flight to Denver, Colorado to get to Houston, Texas for my family of 10 vacation and charge me a additional $3,650.76 for another flight. Southwest had dispense my older children luggage to 2 different states which was Houston, Texas and my twins stroller Denver, Colorado and my medications went to Houston, Texas as well. Southwest took a total of $7,500 in less than 48 hours and my family never flew in the airplane. Southwest took $7,500, ship our luggage to 2 different states, cancelling our flight without proper notice and called the Sherriff department to follow my family around the terminal to give us a ticket that we currently have to see a judge about now to clear our name. On top of paying $7,650.76, Southwest ask me to pay more money for my twins when I had originally paid for them to board the plane. Southwest never gave my family an apology for all of the strife, chaos, shaming, belittlement that’s that my have put on my family.  I will never have my family to board Southwest ever again. I have lost all respect for this airline company. I have encountered some rude and unprofessional workers on the customer-service lines who talks fast pace to get you off the line. Southwest promise my family a flight on 5/28/2022 blast 5:50am, they let my family board the plane as a touring experience, sit down on plane, then ask all of us to exit the plane. My personal preference will be to never paid or even board this airline again. If you want to get rip off, taking advantage of, swindle out of your hard earn money than choose this airplane as your 1st choice. After they refund my $3,650.76, I will never give them my business again. It’s way to many competitors of airlines in the world to be settling for less and making a joke out of people family members just to enjoy a family vacation that you have save for."
267,"✅ Trip Verified |  So after 3 years, I decided to fly on SW airlines again. I've always had an amazing experience with this airline. They delayed my flight 10 minutes before boarding for 3 hrs. (It said on time even when the plane landed and was at the gate). They said it was the air traffic control in MCO. I checked the flight delays on all airlines. There were only 2 (that were non SWA, SWA had tons). Even frontier and spirit had none. AA was flying nonstop with no cancelations.  I then was cancelled and put on standby. I stood at the airport all night until all planes were exhausted (along with other families that had been there way longer than I had). I never got on a plane. In the mean time, I booked a ticket on AA. I asked for a hotel/motel voucher (they laughed). So I took a ride to DFW from Dallas love with a trip booked in the morning. I had to pay for the motel room. I never cancelled my flight. My thought was maybe I'm wrong. The data is lying to me. Yet, I was right. I got on that flight with AA with no problem. I monitored my standby/alternate ticket situation with SW the entire time in air and off. It kept getting pushed back over and over again. To the point that it was landing 3 days from the point I booked. I canceled. I'd love to give my credit to someone needing a flight, but I cannot. I'm the only one it works for.  Never again will I book this airline! They are worse than Spirit or Frontier. BTW, My AA ticket coming back was not delayed or canceled either. I'm sure some have had problems with AA and many other airlines. But, I haven't."
268,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve historically loved Southwest. The two free bags, open seating, reliable flights and communication were excellent. But now this airline is nothing short of a vile, greedy company. In the past year, more than half of my flights have been significantly delayed or outright cancelled. Any getaway comes with an asterisk - best not to make any plans at the destination and save yourself the disappointment. Short notice and some excuse that always dodges responsibility has saddles the customer alone with huge last minute re-booking or hotel fees. To be fair, they always compensate you with a $100 LUV Voucher, which you can put toward the cost of your next Southwest flight, when you’ll inevitably get to repeat this whole process again you masochist. At least there are stale bags of pretzel crumbs to keep you satisfied as you sit and wait a few hours for that last-second cancellation."
269,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest is being horribly deceptive. I recently booked a nonstop flight from RDU to FLL and it was changed to RDU to Baltimore, to Pittsburgh, then to Ft. Lauderdale. Not only is adding 2 stops ridiculous but the fact that you let me book a nonstop and then try to put me through hell with 2 stops is unacceptable. What is going on and what is up with the deception. I cancelled the flight and rebook on another airline. Southwest is the worst by far, never had such stupid things happen with other airlines. It is down right abhorrent that they think this is acceptable."
270,"✅ Trip Verified |  A simple 1 hour flight. Not that hard right? Came to the airport 2 hours before boarding to park, eat lunch, and check my 1 bag since Southwest brags about how great it is to check bags with them. And they never loaded my bag. It’s two days later and I’m still waiting on my bag. Call their rude customer service who gives me attitude saying the only thing they’ll do is reimburse if I show receipts for the crap their incompetence forced me to buy (but only if I prove it’s solely for me). They are truly the worst airline in the USA."
271,"Not Verified |  Really a horrible airline. How they have fallen. Unorganized, clueless employees. Stuck on tarmac in Dallas for over an hour. No explanation. Way overbooked. I took three different flights today and all were late. No weather problems. Seats are for children only. I would give a days pay for the CEO to ride cross country in his planes."
272,"Not Verified |  I am beyond mad! I booked a flight for an employee and when she went to check in online it said they couldn't find her reservation. I called the airline and they said they canceled the reservation due to fraud. There was already a charge on our card. No one had reported this as a fraudulent charge. Southwest offered no real explanation except they bank declined the charge. What bank? It was an Amex and the charge already showed up! Southwest offered no solution, just a sorry. My company flies employees all over the US. I will never use Southwest Airlines again."
273,"Not Verified |  Worst flying experience of my life. Trying to get home from Salt Lake City to Fort Myers Florida, sheer hell. Flight from SLC to DEN was delayed then cancelled. Which caused us to have to stay overnight and SW did not pay for any accommodation’s. Had to pay for hotel, food and then more cash for airport food. Southwest rescheduled a flight to get us home which caused us to have to get up at 3.30 am to catch a flight by 5.30 am only to find when we got at the gate that the flight was not going straight to Midway Michigan as was on the ticket, no. We were going to Houston, take off land, deboard all those passengers, onboard all those passengers. Then fly to Panama City, deboard, onboard passengers, then to Midway. 10 hours sitting on a plane with only 2 bags of snacks since 3.30 am in the morning. Then arrive at Midway to find that flight was delayed. Then delayed again. Finally boarded that flight and made it home after 2 days of sheer hell with Southwest who could not have cared less. None of the employees cared less. Plane was so cold the man sitting next to me called it a meat locker. I had to stay wrapped in fleece and blankets and scarves. No one cared. Their employees are immune to everything because this happens all the time and I’m sure they get screamed at all day. But customers can’t even speak up for fear you will be considered unruly. Ruined what was a wonderful vacation to Moab. We will never use Southwest again. If you want them to screw up you life for days then this is your airline."
274,"Not Verified |  You really take a chance getting to Nashville Airport especially with the crazy traffic. I was flying out of Nashville on Southwest Airline. I live 2 hours away. You could at any time be in a traffic jam for 2 hours. I was lucky arrived 4 1/2 hours early. So I stood in line for 1/2 hour to check in. Oh no, you can't check in. You are too early. Apparently you can't check in with Southwest Airlines more than 3 hours early. Who knew. So I went and sat for another hour and watched people. Very interesting. It's better than being late. Boarding the plane, my seating pass was in the B section. I usually go toward the rear but every seat I wanted was being saved by the passenger next to it. So I had to actually turn around along with other passengers behind me so I could find a seat. Did not know that you are allowed to save seats on Southwest. The stewardess just shrugged her shoulders and asked people to back up. What a mess. What is the point of paying an extra $15 to get to board early."
275,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Phoenix to Burbank last night on flight number 3699, upon out entry into the plane, we were greeted by a flight attendant, Amy. Her pleasant welcoming was wonderful and the same happy and pleasant tone continued, during the flight instruction, as she served until we exited the plane.  I have been flying for years, but have not seen such a remarkable attendant."
276,"Not Verified |  This airline is absolute rubbish. I've had the misery of flying with SW when there have been no other nonstop available for the required travel days, and they never cease to amaze with how 3rd world they are. Wanna get away? No...more like: wanna buy a scheduled flight? Or, wanna purchase an overbooked flight? How about a 6 hr delay followed by a cancelation with absolutely no explanation? Then Southwest is your airline. 0/10, wouldn't recommend to an enemy."
277,"✅ Trip Verified |  Staff services at La Guardia Airport was horrible. I come before time flight of 1 hours and 30 minutes after check in online. I just need drop two bags. However the printing tag for bags doesn't work. I have to wait someone help. Nobody care about me. They let me wait until I can see a gentleman tell me that it is too late to board. They tell me go to Tennessee then catches an other flight back to Maryland. I call my family, my family tell them change me to Long Island airport to get flight to Maryland. Only drop two bags but they make me miss my flight. What is the service?"
278,✅ Trip Verified |  My review is about the customer service I have been receiving. My last two times of flying have been pretty much very dissatisfying. When I flew to Florida in June my flight got canceled I had a book at a hotel I lost a days vacation couldn’t get my money back from the hotel. Then this flight that we just came back from they change the flight so many times that when you add up the loss we took in our time vacationing we lost a whole day. Then I try to use my vouchers and my guest certificate that I got from some friends to book my Southwest vacation. And they wouldn’t take it. But I asked them to extend the six months that I had to use them and they won’t. So they took my money they stole my money. I’ve been flying with Southwest for 12 years I’m so disappointed with what they have turned into.
279,"✅ Trip Verified |  They cancelled my flight from point A to B to C. Point A to B was cancelled due to a snowstorm. I called and asked if they could undo that because I could catch the connecting flight from point B to point C, but they said that it would be an additional $700 if I wanted to do that. Are you kidding me?"
280,"✅ Trip Verified |  Waited for over an hour with no explanations. Rude staff no trust worthy to plan a trip around. You would be much better off the pay more to fly Delta. This is the last straw for Southwest, they will never have me fly again."
281,"✅ Trip Verified | Lihue to Los Angeles. Literally flight was empty and I had one carryon and backpack. Decided to go grab some chocolates as gifts and the gate agent forced me to check my bag to LA because I had purchased the chocolates (basically empty flight). When I boarded the plane even the flight attendants were in shock as to why she would make me gate check the bag. Had I known I would have just left the $50 chocolates, not worth having to check my bag. This is why I never fly SouthWorst, I should have know that this airline is bad but I took a chance, never again. It’s sad when even the flight attendants when I boarded were apologizing for the gate agent. Book a normal airline."
282,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown Southwest Airlines my whole life. I have to say they have been great up until this year. Over the course of 20 flights, 7 have been canceled and 8 have been delayed. I am on a plane today for a 47 minute flight that is delayed because a suitcase machine broke. I mean come on. It is time all airlines are held responsible for this ridiculous service."
283,"✅ Trip Verified |  As the pilot is doing his safety briefing over the intercom (which they have to mandatorily do before takeoff), the Flight Attendant is going through the motions very sarcastically and making funny faces as the pilot is explaining the expectations, roles, and responsibilities of the personnel on the plane if it was to crash.  I then hear the FA  getting upset about someone's luggage ""poking out in the way"". He wasn't very calm about the situation and was on edge.  The messages from the Pilot and the head Flight Attendant kept coming, and I kept listening. I had my Earpods in but paused my music every time a message would come over the intercom. Even with my music paused, I could not understand what was being said over the intercom. I asked the FA  about what beverages they had. He looked at me like I was speaking another language and made drastic body motions pointing at his ears. I knew what he meant but was still shocked that this flight attendant was having such a horrible attitude towards everyone on the plane. "
284,"Not Verified |  Flight was running late on return trip home. It was a late flight, crew did not clean plane, it was filthy. I understand mask are no longer mandated which I am against, but cleaning and sanitizing the plane after passengers depart before new passengers board should be mandatory."
285,"Not Verified |  I have always flown Southwest if at all possible. I want to let you know that my last few flights have been delayed. I think it would serve you well to not give some lame, maybe even untrue response about these delays and just level with us what the problem is. Everyone knows about employee issues and shortage of pilots anyway. The truth is always best"
286,✅ Trip Verified |  Took 9 hours to get home. Southwest kept delaying my flight. No one around to answer questions. This is totally ridiculous. I need a response to what went on before I fly Southwest again.
287,✅ Trip Verified |  Wasn't happy I had to pay a little over $100 to change my flight home because of a messed up flight that would have had 2 stop and taken ten times longer when I always fly through Denver. I should have been able to change it once without being charged. Ridiculous
288,"✅ Trip Verified | Never ever again will I fly Southwest. They canceled the flight but said they can’t pull any bags off canceled flights, even though I didn’t have any connections. So now I’m stuck with an extra $50 Uber fee since they refused to give hotel vouchers and don’t have anything to get ready tonight or tomorrow morning."
289,"✅ Trip Verified | Louisville to Buffalo via Tampa. I had to abruptly leave a business trip when I found out my dog was very ill with little chance of survival. The gate attendant was extremely helpful making sure I had all the proper connecting information, as well as organizing all of my previous cancelled flight information and credits. Once on my first flight the flight attendant was so incredible when I told her about my concern for our delay and the if I did not make my connecting flight I would not make it home in time to say goodbye to my dog. She kindly asked all the people on the plane if they could sit and allow me to get off first and asked everyone to keep my puppy in their hearts. I do not know the name of this wonderful flight attendant, but I will never forget her."
290,Not Verified |  My plane was delayed for an hour in Denver. I checked my bag before my partners. When we get to Desmoines her bag arrived and mine didn't. Come to find put they didn't put my bag on my plane when they had a while extra hour to do so. Southwest tells me I can get it on the next flight. I go to get my bag and that flight was delayed till 11pm. They tell me they will call me and I can get it in the morning. I arrive at 10am and no one available to give me my bag.
291,✅ Trip Verified |  I called the Southwest Airlines customer service line about an issue I had when flying from Chicago to Vegas. They did not care and literally said there is nothing we can do. I get on the airplane and they say things are not working on it. Now I am on my way back from Las Vegas to Chicago and we are over 1hr late. Once again no one cares. Please read reviews before spending extra money on tickets like my business class ticket that does not mean anything.
292,"✅ Trip Verified |  Deplorable customer service! They deserve a negative star. I flew from Syracuse to Charlotte 4/24 when I get my stroller bag I noticed it was partially unzipped, when I go to get the stroller out I see both wheels are broken off and placed under the stroller. The top bassinet/carrier part was also disconnected, which was connected when I checked it in and zipped it up. I know my stroller was intentionally dismantled to make it fit smoother under the plane. I went to the ticket counter where Diane and a manager both told me they do not cover damages only losses. They filled out a report and said I can try to talk to customer service to see if they will replace it. I was sent home with no replacement and no check to replace my infant's stroller. Quickly forward to 5/1, I flew from St. Louis back to Charlotte again, only to have my car seat that I checked in not put on the plane! Once again Diane was at the ticket counter and gave me a loaner car seat. However, my car seat was also in a travel bag that needed to be replaced. Diane brought out the replacement car seat in a travel bag, but refused to loan it to me. I asked to speak to the manager and advised her when Southwest delivers my car seat and travel bag I will give them both (car seat and car seat bag) of theirs back. We stood there for about 30 minutes going back and forth. 20 minutes in she ask me to verify my name as if I had just walked up like Diane didn't already do it. Diane had already got my ticket and verified who I was (which is how I got the loaner car set from the beginning of the ordeal). Security was called, the manager said she couldn't believe I was acting like this and refused to give me the name of her regional manager. When I asked for her to write down her supervisor's name she refused and said you can take it down yourself. She started talking through her teeth at me like I was a child and threatened to walk away if I recorded her. If your acting professionally you wouldn't care if someone recorded you. Everyone after the gate and above the ground were great. Southwest train your ticket counter employees and ramp agents to treat people and their property with respect."
293,"Not Verified |  The absolute worst! I cannot even keep track of how many times I was screwed over by Southwest on this one trip. Booked non-stop both directions flight was changed to connecting, paid for earlybird check-in it never happened - somehow the computer dropped it they said - with zero help or solution to the problem so we were last to board the plane and you know they are messed up with their policy of not letting you choose a seat is the stupidest thing I've ever seen so goodbye Southwest it was nice knowing you."
294,Not Verified |  Planned a trip months in advance and had the perfect times we wanted for nonstop flights only for it to be changed last minute to a two stop flight that was hours later. Had our whole trip planned perfectly and all then of a sudden we have to scramble to find new flights for no reason. The audacity of Southwest Airlines is unreal. I cannot believe this is how we are being rewarded for using Southwest Airlines for over 15 years.  I have never been so personally insulted by an airline in my entire life.
295,Not Verified |  Great customer service from check-in to disembarking. On the inbound we had some delays but staff had informed us about them. I would recommend Southwest Airlines!
296,✅ Trip Verified | I arranged Nashville to Las Vegas travel thru Southwest. It was a special occasion and purchased Business Select ticket and paid premium price. Only thing I got additional is to check in quick and one drink coupon for each traveler (it is $7.00/ per drink if you buy your own). This is total disappointment and not worth to by Business Select.
297,"Not Verified |  This is about customer service. We created a credit card with Southwest last year. They had two sets of nonstop flights to Virginia, which made it easy to travel to see my parents, which was important because we have two small children. A 5-hour flight with a layover has turned into a 12-hour flight due to delays, which isn't easy with small children. Imagine an unplanned 5 hours in the Dulles Airport. Well, these flights were in place throughout COVID, and were full, always. As soon as COVID started to lift, these flights disappeared. Gone. Now, we have at least one stop and more frequently, 2 stops to get to our destination. The same is true for my husband's family in New York. Southwest used to fly direct, and they dropped the direct flights. Today, I was on the phone trying to apply travel vouchers. I was under the impression that I needed to book travel within the expiration timeframe, not complete travel within the expiration timeframe. I have work travel that happens less than a week after the expiration date, and together with this misunderstanding, I thought maybe Southwest would help me out. No such luck; told me it's my problem. Obviously, it is my problem, but I hoped that an airline whose hold message (which I listened to for 20 minutes while my customer service agent took other calls instead of helping me) repeatedly talks about how much they care about customers, might have some flexibility in such a short timeframe. Other businesses help people out to maintain positive customer relations; too bad Southwest has turned a corner and is no longer actually serving the customer. That's why I was loyal to them in the first place. No longer."
298,"✅ Trip Verified |  They don't assign seats. If there's an issue how do you know whose in what seat. My main issue was I wasn't feeling good after we landed and I asked for ginger ale and the flight attendant said ""we don't give drinks out after we land. It wasn't like I was asking for a beer. The flight was delayed but yet the monitors said on time. When they finally told us the flight was delayed, they said it's possible we will board on time so don't leave the area. If we are delayed how can we board early?b You don't have to worry about me flying your airline again. For $1300 it's a waste of money. Couldn't get Wi-Fi nor any entertainment. It wouldn't work."
299,"Not Verified |  Normally love SW. My 4:05 pm flight on 4/14/22 had the absolute worst flight attendant crew I have ever had on any  airline and we have been flying regularly (monthly) for more than 30 years. They were rude to many passengers including my husband and I over trivial things that normally aren’t a big deal. An under-seat item being slightly close to the passengers feet not 100% under and I mean slightly as in barely even noticeable, face mask covering nostrils but not up to bridge of nose, giving a family with a screaming child a hard time during landing, husband lowered mask to tell me something bc I couldn’t hear him and she went off on him, etc. The entire three hour flight with this crew was ridiculously awful. They were not pleasant when coming around for drinks or trash. They acted like they had a chip on their shoulder about something. Normally SW attendants have great personalities and offer decent humor on the flight but you got none of that with this gang. The only time they were nice was when announcing their “we know you have a lot of choices and we thank you for choosing SW” spiel at the end of the flight. If I hadn’t had so many great experiences with SW, I wouldn’t book again. I hope this was an isolated incident bc this crew was lousy and rude. I’m refusing to offer anything but a single star in all categories as I was so upset with this crew but I had no issues with the ground service. The seats are not any more or less comfortable than any other larger airline and the food and beverages  are comparable as well. The inflight wifi was not working on any of my SW domestic flights this week so that was annoying as well."
300,✅ Trip Verified |  More than an hour delay with no transparency about why we've been sitting on the plane for the last hour. Getting back at 230 am or later now. This time of the day is the least amount of air traffic you will ever see - why are we still sitting here? Thanks Southwest. 
301,"✅ Trip Verified |  The absolute worst airline. I wanted to give Southwest another try because a family member raves about the service. I decided to give them another try. Huge mistake. Flights not on time. Sure this airline is cheap but the value and customer service you get is suspect and chances are, your flights going to get cancelled. What happened to this airline? Pay the extra money for a different airline."
302,✅ Trip Verified |  Stewardesses would not allow my carryon even though it met requirements. Then my bag was lost. My boarding pass had wrong information. TSA blamed Southwest Airlines. Southwest Airlines blamed TSA.
303,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew twice on Southwest Airlines. Both times, my flights either got cancelled or the flight got delayed and schedules were changed multiple times since booking. I have horrible experiences with this airline flight cancellation and delay. I Would never fly with Southwest Airlines again. It seems this airline doesn't care about its customers' valuable time at all. I am not surprised when finding on this board so many negative reviews from people expressing the same feelings and frustration."
304,"✅ Trip Verified |  The flight attendant on this plane was much better than my original Experience heading out to Orlando on the 9th. He was very nice, made my sister feel very comfortable. She started having a panic attack and he comforted her and made her feel safe on the plane."
305,"Chicago to Phoenix via Denver. I will never take Southwest Airlines ever again. They were horrible they changed the flight and I had to stay in Chicago another day which I was already there for 2 days. Didn't ask for a hotel because they told me that they don't have any more vouchers so I had to sleep at Chicago airport. The staff in Chicago airport was very unprofessional my luggage got to Phoenix before I did and then when I picked my luggage up in Phoenix, it was broken. Nobody could give me the answer to what happened. I will be sticking with Delta and American airlines from now on. I was traveling for my wedding, and we had to push it back for 1 day, which cost me and my hubby now a lot because I was late getting back to Phoenix."
306,"Not Verified |  I was highly unsatisfied when flying with Southwest. Being currently active duty, I was told I could not pre board unless in uniform. Anyone in the military knows you are a target when wearing your uniform in public places and are told not to. Southwest either needs to let all military members pre board or none at all. They say they support military but obviously not. Do not fly Southwest, unless you want to deal with rude, and nasty service."
307,Not Verified |  I want to complement the lady that I spoke to on the phone. Her name is Julie and she helped me a lot and she was extremely nice. She was very patient as I made a big mistake and we had to do everything over again. 
308,Not Verified |  I would never recommend anyone fly with a company that does not care about it's customers. I bought a flight during very early COVID for $331. As the time for flying come near the warnings made me cancel. I rescheduled hoping the pandemic would calm. Again I cancelled. Since it was a certain fair they deducted $100 from my flight and issued a Luv voucher. This was only good for 6 months. I ended up scheduling for 8 months to fly again. Southwest told me I can't extend my voucher and took the other $221! I am out the $331 without ever receiving any services whatsoever. I contacted customer service to see if I could get any credit for my upcoming flight and they replied sorry. I'm sorry I ever booked on SW in the first place.
309,"Not Verified |  Ridiculous delays. We boarded the plane late due to weather. That was fine but after sitting an hour and a half waiting to pull away from the gate, I am cross. The flight crew gave at least 4 different reasons why we could not take off and we are still waiting. I have flown only one Southwest flight in my life that was actually on time. Did I mention that my husband had just had surgery and the longer flight was painful."
310,"Not Verified |  I am beyond frustrated with this airline as a concerned mother whose child is flying alone for the first time. I called the airline over 10 times and received a different story each time, to make matters even worse you can't speak to a manager or a supervisor because apparently they have none. Eventually I found out you can talk to a service coordinator. No wonder no one's on the same page and they all give you different answers! Who trained them or taught them what the airline procedures are. They don't care that you can't afford for the flight to keep going up like they said they have no control over it but neither do they have control of the procedures. I couldn't even book my child a minor under my account because they are so worried about whatever point system they have going on. They obviously need a family plan where you can have your spouse and children under. Especially for someone who gets frustrated on the internet quickly. They have made the beginning of my trip with my daughter hell and my finances tight because they had to refund me and were so happy to book another flight because apparently I'm so rich. I can't wait 3 days till the refund comes in to get another flight because I would have lost the price I could pay. So I had to come up with money for another flight which of course went up the next day but hey at least she said ""I'm Sorry""."
311,"Not Verified |  Will never trust Southwest Airlines again. What a fiasco trying to get out of Tampa on April 2nd. Eventually canceled our flight and offered absolutely no guidance on what to do at that point. Waited in line for information for 2 hours. Waited at baggage line for 2 hours to retrieve soaking wet suitcases. Finally decided to rent a car, in line for 3 hours and drive to Buffalo instead of waiting till Wednesday or Thursday for a new flight. I especially felt sorry for all of the families with children having to go thru the same ordeal as myself and my husband. Southwest you are not the airline you used to be."
312,Not Verified |  I have been a loyal Southwest customer but I am now looking for other options. Two days and two canceled flights is too much. I understand that may not be their fault but their customer service is no longer like it used to be. They are not helpful at all and you are just on your own which is very unfortunate. Right now I would be very gracious in giving them a 1 star rating. Very disappointed!
313,"Not Verified |  Worst experience. Flight delayed more than 3 hours without cancellation and/or chance to reschedule. No documented bags returned. No apologies, super deficient customer service at the airport."
314,Not Verified |  This use to be my favorite airline to fly with but that has changed! Customer service is not the same. Southwest in my opinion used to have the best customer service. I have flight refund that expires this year and due to being pregnant I have been told I cannot fly. I reached out to the airline to see if they could extend my refund since it expires in September and was told they will not do that.  Southwest just isn’t what it use to be and it’s disappointing.
315,"Not Verified | New Orleans to Richmond via Atlanta. Not very pleased at all. A representative for Southwest during baggage drop directed us to an A list/priority line. After we waited 15 mins, when we were next in line; she redirected us yet again to ANOTHER line that was WAY longer and we barely made our flight from MSY to ATL (#2772) with 5 minutes to spare. We had to literally RUN so we wouldn't miss it. EVERYBODY had boarded ahead of us and the door to the gate was even closed. I'm still flabbergasted by this situation and will definitely keep this horrible experience in my head for future, possible flights with Southwest."
316,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Las Vegas to Denver. I current flew with 3 of my co-workers from Denver to Las Vegas on March 30th. Flight number 486. We were delayed 3 hours due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft. Once onboard the head of the flight crew took the time to have a conversation and lighten the mood. Then the comedic events of the flight staff made for a great flight. Then returned on April 1st. Flight number 876. Again the laughter created by the flight staff made for a great experience."
317,"Not Verified |  I had flown just yesterday. I was early, the line was ridiculous so I sent my 2 daughters to go shopping and stayed with my son. We all ate and come to find out our plane was delayed until 12 so we waited, then our gate changed and was delayed 2 more hours. They boarded us and all my children had to sit alone away from me. My daughter was only 12 and was crying the whole flight. Never flying southwest ever again."
318,"Not Verified |  Absolute garbage, not only was the inside of the plane filthy, when we tried to use Southwest again to get home they cancelled the flight and didn’t provide any form of assistance in hotels-motels or even food. Was stuck in the airport all night would never use this airline. I try to be reasonable, but this is insane that there was absolutely no form of assistance given to me and the other 13 people I was with."
319,✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest cancelled my flight prior to the flight about 12 hours and no additional flights were offered. I was asked to contact my agency and they simply did not care. They blamed technical/technology and weather but frontier or spirit airlines are working fully functional for the same route. Terrible company decisions and they just don’t care.
320,"Not Verified |  Flight (direct) was pushed back and fourth for 5 hours yesterday then cancelled and rebooked for 6:05 today (w/one stop) meaning a long drive back home and getting up in the middle of the night. The extra early bird charge was not refunded and not given back on the new flight. $40 due back. Once in Chicago things were delayed for a couple hours again. Unfortunately my wife and my daughter whom had a soccer game today to play in front of specific college coaches was operating on 3 hours sleep now. They arrived in Phoenix with no time to go to hotel and check in because HERTZ rental car (Zero stars) had a super long line and not enough customer service agents to handle them. Hertz cancelled our original reservation charged triple the price for the rental which was a downgrade, charged for overage hours and charged for insurance and prepaid gas full tank (they wont use) which was all declined. I'll talk with both of these incompetent companies the next couple days. If your traveling do your due diligence and fly the best airline at the best time of the week. Last but not least we cancelled one day at the hotel which ended up cancelling the whole stay leaving us to frantically find another hotel away from her team hotel. Looking at the internet and talking with many people today I believe that people should be cautious and think twice about booking flights with Southwest and Rental Cars with Hertz as many people have had similar experiences just not all at the same time/trip. Frustrated but safe. Customer service has taken a real dive since our last election in this country. "
321,"Not Verified |  I was a loyal southwest fan for 25 plus years. No more. After this fiasco of them cancelling flights I am done. Offered no hotel voucher no food voucher after waiting 4 hours in a line only to be told what I could have done myself. Offered to book us 4 days later on a flight - 4 days! We cancelled and got refunded and will now use competitor airlines. Let my wife, myself and our 2 kids down. Gone are the fun friendly customer service winning days at Southwest. Avoid them at all costs."
322,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and paid for a return home tickets months in advance. On April 2, 2022 our flight was rescheduled from 4 pm to 1130 pm. While waiting the long hours we were notified that the 1130 pm flight was canceled with not alternative flight scheduled. We were stuck in the Orlando airport with not means are reason for the cancellation. They have my paid ticket but canceled my flight without any additional information. The flight was initially canceled due to bad weather but as of 745 pm EST the weather is clear. A flight was boarded for Phoenix Arizona, I’m sure Houston Texas is before Arizona. This airline does not care about stranding their customers."
323,"Not Verified | Detroit to Punta Cana via Chicago. What a joke. Pilots were over hours, but they told us it was the weather, but Delta, Spirit, and every other airline made it there. Way to go, Southwest will never fly again."
324,"✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Chicago. Southwest has completely ruined my trip, i have missed my cousins wedding due to all the delays, cancelations and layovers today. I have had my flight canceled three times today. My original flight was scheduled to go non-stop Denver to Chicago O'Hare at 7am, that was canceled. I was rebooked for a flight leaving Denver at 5am with a layover in Austin, that flight was canceled. I was then rebooked for a flight out over Denver to Dallas that was delayed an hour. My then connecting flight from Dallas to Chicago O'Hare was delayed 5 times before being canceled. I am now booked on a flight to Houston and then to Chicago midway just to get me close to home. Canceled on three times, have been in an airport for 11 hours now, still have two flights to go which are not guaranteed not to be canceled and im not even flying to my home airport where my car is, i will have to pay $100+ for a ride from midway to O'hare and 12 hours after i was supposed to originally land. When i asked for some kind of compensation for my troubles and extra expenses, i was lied to by the supervisor at the gate saying i should’ve been offered vouchers this morning which i wasn’t because i was not at the airport when my first two flights got canceled and then she changed her story to say southwest could not provide compensation because my flights were canceled due to atc when in reality, as reported on the news, southwest as had a company wide system shutdown today which in fact is southwest’s fault and should compensation me for what will be almost 20 hours in an airport and/or plane, a 12 hour delay in my arrival to my destination, my arrival to the incorrect airport and my costs of a taxi from midway to O'hare."
325,"Not Verified | Portland to San Diego. I had connecting flights from PDX to SAC to LAS to SAN. When we landed in SAC, the staff found me on the plane and let me know that there was a connecting flight leaving in 20 minutes that would be direct to SAN and get me there 3 hours earlier (since we just found out there was a delay). They took the initiative to make my experience great, arrive early, and feel confident my bags and tickets were taken care of (which was important flying alone with my kids). I highly recommend."
326,"✅ Trip Verified |  I missed the first leg of my flight and had to schedule 1 way. Now they canceled my return flight. I asked them how to resolve this issue and they said I needed to purchase another ticket (keeping the money from my original purchase that they canceled). Worst airline ever, worst customer service."
327,✅ Trip Verified |  Computer problems again. Delayed flights for hours and this is just the start of the snowball effect to ruin the rest of my small business trip. Never flying Southwest again. Every time there's delays caused by their own shortcomings. I wish I could charge full amount and not provide my end of the bargain in business with no recourse.
328,✅ Trip Verified |  They literally always disappoint. I am now stuck at the airport because their system is down. Was supposed to board at 4:30 am and currently still waiting they are delaying other flights as well as connections. I won’t be flying southwest anymore. They literally always delay and it’s ridiculous.
329,"Not Verified |  I booked my hotel like I always do through Southwest to get points. I was to earn 10,000 points for my stay via the Southwest concierge. Usually my points hot within 4 days after travel is complete. My flight hit and my car rental hit. I was waiting to book a trip for my wife and I to Austin to celebrate a friends redo of their 50th birthday. Points still have not hit after 3 weeks and now I believe they are taking their time out of spite. Now they are telling me they have to wait for hotel to notify on how many points they need to apply to my account. This is complete rubbish, because it tells you how many points when you book and when you get confirmation email from Southwest. At the time the 10,000 points would have given me a total of 72,000 points and I could have booked a trip for us both for 69,000 points. Now it will cost 120,000 points. I travel about twice a month and it looks like this will increase to probably 3 times per month. Going to American Airlines now. Thanks for nothing Southwest. Hope it was worth it."
330,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to MegaCon last August and went with my dependable standby. The arrival flight took off on time but was 20 minutes behind (weather related), whereas departing flight back to RDU was delayed an hour due to custom issues with the Orlando aircraft arriving from Montego Bay. Even with the Delta surge, MCO was packed with people. Coming out of the pandemic, SWA is feeling the pinch in terms of staffing and aircraft availability."
331,Not Verified |  Shame on Southwest Airlines. My husband and I and our family have used Southwest for over 20 years. This past March 12 we were supposed to leave Portland Maine at 5:30 in the morning and we received a cancellation for no reason on March 11 at 11 PM in the evening. We could not get through to the site via Internet or phone on how to reschedule a new flight. Since we had reservations for two weeks in Orlando all paid for we needed to get on a flight as soon as possible. So my husband tried and tried and waited on hold for almost an hour before he finally just gave up and decided to book a different flight and the only one we could fly find was from Boston which is a 2 Hour Drive instead of a 15 min drive to Portland. The only flight we could find was for 530 leaving Boston that morning which meant we had to leave Portland Maine by 2 AM. We did not sleep at all that night. On top of that the flight that was connecting was delayed as well. The real kicker is that because we did not follow Southwest Airlines rules for rescheduling a canceled flight we had to pay $700 more to drive two hours longer to get to the airport to actually get on a flight. And the person who answered our phone call later on was like oh well too bad you didn’t do it the way you were supposed to. I just don’t understand how a an airline can cancel the flight out of the blue for no reason and not assist their travelers. and then along the way the attendants were rude and obnoxious and in no way helpful or kind. We are still trying to figure out how we can get refunded our money over something that we did not do we did not cancel the flight Southwest airlines canceled the flight. They should honor the fact that we had booked our flights months ahead of time. And they should do a better job when canceling a flight to assist customers and getting to where they need to be.
332,"✅ Trip Verified | Went to attend 90s Con in Hartford, CT for the weekend beginning 3/11. Outgoing departure was on time, good customer service and unproblematic plane change. But due to the winter weather, SWA cancelled my return flight on Sunday—and they didn’t notify me until an hour before my flight was due to leave (via email). They rebooked my flight for Tuesday and I couldn’t do it. I ended up booking a last minute flight on Delta—that got delayed as well — so I ended up staying an extra day. I wish these big airlines had contingency plans for getting customers home. Had SWA rebooked me for Monday I would’ve been happier. Anyway, it worked out for me — both airlines sent me flight vouchers (SWA sent me a $250 one) and I got home fine. I just won’t fly SWA to New England during the winter."
333,"✅ Trip Verified |  Been sitting on this plane since 7.35. Flight supposed to take off at 8. It's now 8.20 and no sign of movement. Someone actually just got on the plane 20 minutes after take off time. And still on the app, it says this flight departure is on time. What a joke. I'd rather pay double to fly with a real airline."
334,"Not Verified |  We had our flight home canceled and were notified by text 6 hours before hand. No help re-booking or anything just left to us to call and figure it out. After hours on the phone we got re-booked on the next available flight which was 2 days later. Cost us over $1,000 in car rental extension and hotels and meals. Found out cancelation was not due to bad weather but told it was due to air traffic control issues whatever that means. So we sent a request for Southwest to pay our extra expenses and they said ""yeah I know I left you, your wife and 2 children stranded for 2 days for ambiguous reasons but hey here is a $150 voucher to fly on our airline again"". Really? I guess that is fitting because with the voucher and another $100 cash I might be able to get a one way ticket, maybe, leaving me stranded again. Southwest stopped caring long ago. "
335,"Not Verified |  My husband had been an A-List member of Southwest Airlines for over 20 years. He traveled extensively for his work and we always appreciated the special perk he received of priority boarding due to his status. When Covid hit and all airlines came to a halt, his company put a moratorium on all travel - even after the airlines were back up and running. Last fall he received a promotion from Southwest that if he traveled one round trip flight anywhere, he could retain his A-List status. Unfortunately, he had been diagnosed with cancer back in the spring of 2021 and began undergoing cyberknife treatments in September 2021. His doctors specifically told him he should not travel through the remainder of the year as he was immunocompromised. We contacted Southwest and let them know the situation. The agent with whom I spoke advised that if we could provide a certification from his oncologist, they would consider our request to extend his status despite the fact he was unable to travel even the bare minimum in 2021. Yesterday, after going through a second appeal process following an initial denial of our request from Southwest, we were told they would not be able to honor our request. I am absolutely appalled that this airline, which our entire family has supported religiously for the past 20 years (in addition to all of my husband's business travel), would not consider these extenuating circumstances and grant him an exception. Shame on you Southwest for not having more heart. Perhaps if someone in a leadership role is faced with the same daunting cancer diagnosis and finds themselves undergoing this brutal treatment, they'll reconsider this ridiculous policy. We couldn't be more disappointed at this time in the airline and its leadership."
336,"Not Verified |  We were flying on March 21, 2022 from Maui to Honolulu at 1.30 pm. It was a very hot day and my 8 year old daughter was very thirsty. The water fountain at gate 13 was broken so I told her we get water in the plane. It was a 30 minute flight so I knew there wouldn’t be service during flight. We were at the back of the plane, it was completely empty and I saw a male and female flight attendants at the back, 4 seats away from us. They were boarding the front of the plane. My 8 year old went to asked the lady for water very politely and she turns to my kid and says ""No, sit down"" in a very rude way. My kid came back so I went and asked the gentleman if he could please give me some water for my kid. He literally reached in front of them on a cart and gave me a blue can of water. I said to the lady, ""my kid just wanted water and it was right in front of you, that was mean"" she followed me to my seat and said something, I said the water was right in front of you. She raised her voice and said ""Do we have a problem here?"" At that moment I figured she wanted to get a reaction out of me, maybe to kick me off the plane so I said ""no, no problem, I’m sorry"". Never flying this airline again. Inhumane to a child that all she needed was a cup a worker. "
337,Not Verified |  Me and my family got rebooked to Southwest because Spirit got cancelled out of nowhere (and we are never flying Spirit again) but anyway the treatment was good and the wifi was good but the only bad thing was really the seating system where it’s first come first serve meaning everyone just chooses their seats upon boarding the plane. Everyone in my family was spread out and sitting next to random people and it was good besides that.
338,"Not Verified |  My nonstop flight at 3.50 pm Sunday March 13th from Dallas to Tulsa was cancelled 24 hours before flight time. I received an email which I later found meant no text notification. They auto booked me for 10.00 pm flight, then was delayed two hours, which puts me getting home at 1.30 am. No apologies, no explanation was given, weather is one thing but cancelling a fight because you didn’t sell enough seats is terrible customer service. Especially when I’ve been a loyal client for decades. I was really disappointed with this company. Way too many delays and cancellations in the past year. Covid is over and no longer an excuse. My time is way more valuable than buying an inexpensive plane ticket. I will be finding a new carrier when my points and funds are gone. So sad what’s happening to them. Will not recommend anymore."
339,"Not Verified |  I’ve flown a minimum of once a month with Southwest for the last year. At this point the savings are not worth the absolute madness the yo-yo delays and last minute cancellations cause. This airline has far too much uncertainty for anyone depending on reliability. Unless you are super flexible with departure and arrival time (by hours or days) , don’t waste your time and sanity on Southwest."
340,"✅ Trip Verified | Completely cancelled my flight less than 2 hours before departure. Not even a single delay. Have asked for a refund multiple times and they have just sent two vouchers which I do not want to consider since I will not be flying with this airline again. Have tried contacting through email, Twitter, and Facebook - no response unless it’s a robot. Have waited on the line multiple times. Once they hung up after I said hello and the second time I had to hang up after 2 hours to go on with my life. Terrible airline and terrible customer service."
341,"Not Verified |  I never book flights on low cost airlines with very high hopes. It started when I got to the gate, the staff was nice and they are enforcing very strict COVID rules, something very important in these times. Before long we were boarding, which was surprisingly easier than with other airlines. You got to choose your seat, which was nice (as long as your preferred seat wasn’t already taken), and the taxi and takeoff was smooth and uneventful. Once we had leveled off, the cabin crew came around with drinks and snacks, and while their selection was a little limited, I understand why they can’t have a vast array of refreshments. The cabin crew was very nice, and while there was no in flight entertainment, I don’t see that as a factor that lowers the experience value because it’s just so easy to bring your own entertainment on board these days. Our descent, landing, and taxi were smooth, and once we got to our gate, I exited the plane feeling refreshed at the experience I had just had."
342,"Not Verified |  First customer service rep I called couldn’t help me and told me my flight was delayed when on the app and text message I received said it was cancelled. She told me she doesn’t understand why that’s happening and gave me another number to call. I have been on hold on the phone for 3 hours and still currently waiting for my call to be answered. My flight was cancelled 6 hours before we were supposed to leave. Not only is this incredibly inconvenient, but there are no flights going out until Wednesday night. A handful of other airlines are leaving Indianapolis and going to fort Meyers. Maybe if southwest stopped overbooking their flights, they wouldn’t constantly get cancelled and be blamed for “bad weather.”"
343,"Not Verified |  I have been flying Southwest Airlines from the early 80's until now on and off. The reason I don't get to fly often is due to my work situations. However, when circumstances allows me my first choice is SWA.  For the first time my experiences with SWA my flight was cancelled by Air Traffic Control few days ago. I called SWA support to ask any flight out of MCO in the next 24hrs, and got the next day flight out from MCO. The person who helped me bent backward to find me a flight, even though it took me out of the way and longer time. This is the service you get even you are not a frequent flyer. Southwest Airlines go to great length to please anyone."
344,Not Verified |  Horrible! What has happened to this airline? We were supposed to fly at 9:30 yesterday. Delayed to 4:30. Then 9:30. Then cancelled. Forced to pay for a hotel in Orlando. Scheduled to fly today at 10:05. Already delayed which makes me doubt we make our connecting flight. So stressed.
345,"Not Verified |  Worst experience I've ever had on a plane. Flight was 1/2 hour late taking off when captain and stewards shut down flight to accommodate a panicky customer. We wait another hour, prepare to de-ice and take off when another customer needs something out of the cargo hold. Flight shuts down again. Customer reps come aboard to relay that all connecting flights are cancelled because there's no way to get there in time. Chaos ensues as half the plane de-boards. A single customer service rep, who has no idea what she's doing, attempts to coral all fifty passengers and fails. What a waste of three hours of my time. Poor communication, time and customer management. Will not use this airline again, don't recommend them."
346,"Not Verified |  Becoming one of the worst airlines you could fly with, late to everything! We have flown Southwest for years now and they are more worried about getting the most amount of flight tickets bought and not about proper customer service."
347,"✅ Trip Verified |  Every time I inadvertently fly with them I regret it. Besides the lack of comfort and amenities they they offer, they also are the only airline company that makes boarding as difficult as possible. Also their support of US Service Member traveling on Govt Orders is only superficial. Meaning they will only accommodate service members of people can witness it. "
348,"Not Verified |  My review is for the Southwest staff at the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport. It wasn’t crowded. There were no long lines. And yet every desk employee was rude, grumpy, non-smiling, and abrupt. My questions were met with sour looks, wrong information (it turned out), and I have MS and although I don’t appear disabled, I walk with great difficulty. My husband was with me. We needed a wheelchair. There were no pushers at all and we were treated like it was too much to ask or expect. We weren’t blaming Southwest about the wheelchairs but that is who we had to ask for it. But that wasn’t a main issue. The desk agents in arranging our new flights treated us like scum under his feet, he made mistakes, instead of answering our questions he said “You’re done so move away.” My husband was trying to push my wheelchair, I was rolling my carry on beside me, my tote on my lap, my husbands back pack We had been stuck in Phoenix 2 nights due to weather. We were smiling, respectful, polite and understanding…on purpose. It didn’t help. He again told us to get out of the way quickly. In 2 days, back at the airport, after our new flight didn’t show on the APP, waiting on hold 3 hours, never receiving the previously requested call back, Finally we got an email with the flight confirmation. The desk agent had no one else in line, and couldn’t find us in the computer. My husband looked up the email with the confirmation to show her and she rudely said ”I don’t want to see any phones. Don’t show me papers (we hadn’t). You aren’t booked.” We were but somehow she couldn’t find us until she tried for over 10 minutes. Not sure if it was system or human problem. Ok so no wheelchair pushers on duty so that was a wreck. I’m pushing 2 carryons beside my wheelchair, husband is carrying 2 items plus pushing. We get to security. No help at all. An agent said we needed a pusher and to go to the information desk and ask them to call for a pusher through security. The info man said ”I don’t know who told you that but I don’t do that.” So security was a mess. I can’t walk or stand long enough. I needed to stay in my chair. I was greeted with sour looks and impatience. when they asked if I could try to walk through the scanner. I can’t. And I can’t help my disease.  I waited a long time before a woman security person came to get me through. I didn’t mind waiting. I did mind being spoken to in such a rude manner. Because we had to check out of the hotel 6 hours before our flight, we had several hours to wait at the airport and gate. And the list of rude Southwest staff went on. I’ll stop here."
349,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I both have travel funds with the same confirmation number, but my funds are expiring this month and his in December. I contacted them to have them change my expiration date and they refused. It makes no sense. I have been an a-list customer for over 5 years, but they apparently do not value loyalty."
350,"✅ Trip Verified | RNO-LAX r/t. As always, at least for us, Southwest is the best carrier out of Reno. Flight out was delayed by 30 minutes but we were kept well informed. In fact it turned in to only a 20 minute delay and an on time arrival in LA. Check-in, boarding and flight all went smooth. Served a drink and snack. Protocols for Covid were in place for the one hour flight which is no problem. Shocking airport traffic in the terminal at LAX for a Thursday evening but that has nothing to do with the airline. Flight out of LAX was remarkably smooth. Departure at 10.35 am and literally lifted off in air at 10.36. Arrived 15 minutes early in Reno. Used my points so flight was free except for $5 in taxes. Can't beat it. Good job Southwest."
351,"✅ Trip Verified | Great price for airfares, but you pay for it with their customer service. They are lazy, do not take time to help their customers, and are selfish with their time. I was recently in Dallas airport and called the desk because their agent had made a mistake with my ticket. I accidentally left my AirPods at the desk. I boarded my plane and noticed they were missing. I quickly checked the location and called the desk. I explained I was already on the plane, so that I couldn’t get off. We had about 75 people still boarding, and the door was still open. The agent at the desk, said if I have time, I will walk them to your gate. (This was at gate 4/6, and I’m at gate 10, not far at all) of course, she did not have time, and now I’m being told I have to pay for FedEx to have them shipped back, and that’s if they are found. It’s so sad that they encourage laziness and the lack of customer service."
352,"Not Verified |  Within my four flights (to and from NM) there has been a total of 8 hours worth of delays/waiting. Our first flight we were going to NM from Maine, and, due to a technical error, my name was misspelled and it took staff a very long time both times to fix the name on the boarding pass (but I don’t blame the staff, I blame the system that Southwest uses). We were already there two hours early so we had time to do the things we needed to do before boarding, but Southwest Airlines will be giving you so much time that you won’t know what to do with yourself. We were told that the very first delay was due to the plane being “too heavy” because of passengers, baggage, and fuel. After they sorted that out, we were finally on our way. After we landed for our connecting flight in Baltimore, we waited an hour on the pavement to get to a terminal because all of them were full. Once we finally got to a terminal in Baltimore we had to haul butt to the other side of the Airport because our connecting flight was going to be missed (no thanks to Southwest). This being my first time flying, I decided not to let it bother me too much. However now that we are flying back, and dealing with the same extensive delays and terrible customer reimbursement of funds and services, I decided it might be time to give a cent. I’d like to note that all the staff have been so helpful and wonderful this whole time, the flight attendants and pilots have been extremely kind and apologetic for this airlines absurd behavior and policies. Right now, it’s 9:56pm in Baltimore and our flight was supposed to leave at 9:05pm. We were already delayed 30 minutes, and as soon as passengers started lining up to get on the delayed plane, someone on the intercom stated that suddenly the plane is unsafe to travel in, and therefore have cancelled that flight. They ended up keeping us in the dark for a while until we were told to move to Terminal B7 instead of B9. We’re awaiting the plane to leave that’s currently there so that a new plane can pull up. However I’m expecting at least an hour more of waiting because they will need to fuel, pack, and board the plane. Overall, I’ll give a 5 star rating to your very helpful, kind, and patient staff. I’ll give a 0 star rating to everything else. We were in the dark the whole time, and it was made very clear to us that if the airline messed up, it was on us. Southwest even over-boards the planes for profit with no guarantee of a seat. So if it’s overpacked and there isn’t a seat for you, someone is expected to voluntarily give up their seat. And if they don’t, I think they’ll try to find another plane for you but I’m not 100% sure - either way, what we’re they thinking? You don’t board a plane without plans? They don’t care, as long as they get that $$$."
353,"✅ Trip Verified |  Consistently late at every portion. First leg shifted my departure 2 hours earlier and almost missed my flight out. On the way back because of overfilling fuel and change of planes they Added a day to my trip, put me up in a motel with literally ceiling falling down. Then next flight first in the morning is 1.5 hour late. Over the last two years this has become the standard for southwest. What used to be one of the best airlines has been downgraded to frontier and spirit level. I do not recommend flying southwest if you are sensitive to time or events. Terrible for business planning. If you want free bags… sure they’re included."
354,Not Verified |  I just want to say thank you for the wonderful treatment for people with disabilities. You made my trip so much easier for me. Thank you so much!
355,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew Southwest airlines Phoenix to Seattle return. I was not impressed how their seating is now. I liked it better when it was assigned seating. My flight going to Seattle was fine. I traveled with my husband and i sat by him no problem. Coming back was a different story the plane was so full i wasn't able to sit with my husband. Now if if i wanted to go on a trip alone i would have. I did not like I had to sit in the middle of 2 strangers.  Definitely wasn't pleased at all with southwest.
356,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked this flight around November for them to tell me that it’s cancelled and to then book me for a flight the next day? How are we over weight the day of the flight ? That’s something you should be keeping an eye on since you made the flight available, I’ve never had a issue with SW till today, I even opened a credit card with them a few months back, I’m about to close off because this is nonsense ! I paid for a non stop flight now I have to change planes (which I’m horrible at. I paid for A group and now I’m in a C group, way to ruin my day."
357,"Not Verified |  So they keep canceling all my non-stop flights and booking me on flights that get in at midnight etc and lose my luggage also. Cancelled my family's flights for Easter vacation to Disney World and never even re-booked us or even bothered to contact us and tell us. We found out by going online, where are our flights? Maybe we should call. The agent we spoke to said whoops, this is weird! Now we had to take whatever flight was left and arrive in Orlando at 11.45pm! Missed an entire day and paid full price. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of this airline! They simply cancel everything and rearrange your schedule and guess what you have no say! "
358,"Not Verified |  What a horrible airline. We probably had a once in a lifetime concert to go to in Phoenix that we booked 3 months ago. We did have snowfall today on Thursday that ended at 7pm. They canceled their entire flight schedule for the next day Friday to Phoenix. In fact all outgoing flights are canceled and we only had 4 inches of snow. My wife talked to the airlines multiple times and every time she was hung up on, she was polite and she didn't use profanity like I would have. I was on hold for 75 minutes and hung up. When I try to contact him again I was told I would be on hold for over 2 hours. We lost over 2,300 in hotel bills concert tickets and the flight. I will be surprised if I get reimbursed for the flight."
359,"✅ Trip Verified | I been traveling once a month from Dallas to Houston for work, I leave early in the morning and return the same day in the evening since is a short flight I am able to do so. Since I started traveling to Houston none of the return flights left on time, at the beginning I was thinking one delay may happen but 10/10 delays? I also asked a cousin that works at the Love Field airport and she confirmed that Southwest is pretty famous for their flight delays and she hates it a lot because that also makes her stay working late - I will look for another option."
360,"Not Verified |  My parents took a Southwest flight today from San Jose CA, through Houston to BWI. My mom had to be in a wheelchair and helped with entering and exiting the plane etc. When my parents got home they called me to tell me what an amazing experience they had the entire day with Southwest. How kind and helpful everyone was to them. They were beyond grateful"
361,"✅ Trip Verified |  Open seating, you and your significant other will get split up. They will also split you up in boarding classes as well. Out of 1000 flights in my life this was literally the worst experience of my life."
362,Not Verified |  You will never get anywhere on time. This is my 4th flight in two weeks and none of them left on time. This is the third flight where we waited on the gate to open up and we have been waiting for an hour now.
363,✅ Trip Verified |  I made the mistake of flying Southwest. The staff at the gate are rude and condescending. It's bad enough my experience going to San Antonio was bad. This just put the icing on the cake of the worse experience ever. It's going to take a lot for me to fly this airline again.
364,✅ Trip Verified | Very disappointed with Southwest. Will not be looking to fly with them again. Supposed to leave Colorado Springs at 8.15am. Didn't leave till almost 10.30 because of oil! Something that should have been done before loading! Just about missed my connecting flight because of it. Gave myself an almost 2 hour layover so that wouldn't happen. Finally got on connector plane at Chicago only for that plane to be shut off cause of technical problems. Southwest you are not making anyone feel safe in your planes!
365,"Not Verified | I flew to Denver on December 21, 2021, with a return flight scheduled for January 3, 2022. I got caught in the biggest, most devastating fire ever in Colorado's history. My family and I were evacuated. This was a very traumatic experience and I was exposed to Covid. I tried to schedule a Covid test before the day of my flight but the earliest I could get an appointment was January 3. I bore the expense to drive home out of respect for other passengers and my inability to test due to the chaos and tragic circumstances surrounding the Marshall Fire. I received the following response today: Dear Brenda, We are sorry to learn that you were unable to travel as planned due to not feeling well, and we hope you are doing well. The reservation in question was booked at our Wanna Get Away fare, which carry restrictions such as being nonrefundable. And, while we wish we could honor every request to refund a nonrefundable fare, the reason we are able to offer these fares at such a substantial discount in the first place is because they are a firm commitment to travel. In this situation, the originally-ticketed Passenger still has the flexibility to apply these travel funds to a new reservation provided the reservation is canceled at least 10 minutes prior to travel and travel is completed by the expiration date. We are hopeful you will be able to travel with us soon. We know you have a choice when you fly, and we hope you will continue to choose Southwest. We would truly appreciate the chance to welcome you onboard soon.  I canceled out of respect for other passengers. Incidentally, I did have Covid making for a miserable drive home. I could have easily boarded that plane and saved myself a 14-hour drive on treacherous icy roads, not to mention the expense. SWA is more concerned about money than safety! I gave 24 hours notice and I guarantee my seat did not remain empty with all of the cancellations that were taking place at that time. I think SWA is despicable for putting the concern of other passengers behind the almighty dollar."
366,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had unused travel funds, that we were using to travel this month. My husband fell sick so to ensure everyone’s safety I had him take a covid test, which came back positive. I called the airline to let them know that we couldn’t complete our trip due to Covid and asked for a one time curtesy extension for one month. They said to call back after the funds expired, and they would offer a one time 6 month extension. The funds expired today, and I was told they would send me a voucher of $6 , and some change, because they have to deduct $100 as a penalty for not using the funds by the date. There was no way around it. Very disappointed, and will never be using Southwest again."
367,Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Honolulu. I was supposed to go on a trip the ending of this month but I had to reschedule because something came up so I called Southwest customer service and they told me that they could only extend it for 6 months and then today they called back and said I have only till the end of next month now - idk how is that possible?
368,"Not Verified |  I recently came down with COVID and had to cancel several flights. Southwest was amazing - all I had to do was sign on the app, hit a button, and receive credit for a future flight. American had me on hold for 2.5 hours, and I still haven't been able to reach anyone. Holiday Inn was able to refund my flight, although I had to argue a bit. I hate their boarding process, but with this customer service I am forever a customer. Easy to do business with Southwest!"
369,"✅ Trip Verified |  Today my husband and I headed back home to Texas from our honeymoon in Cancun. It was the absolute best flight we have ever been on even with the flight being delayed. All because of the incredible flight attendant, Tammy on our flight 308 on January 14th, 2022 at 7:30PM. She was so sweet to announce our celebration and even gifted us with an unforgettable memory of her generosity. Wish we could’ve thanked her more she went truly above and beyond. Hope to see our fellow Texan in the future!"
370,"Not Verified | We were supposed to fly back home to Oklahoma City on October 9th. On the day we were supposed to fly home, we received a text stating that our flight had been cancelled but had been rebooked for a 4am flight the next day. At approximately 3:30am we got a text cancelling that flight as well. Then they offered my wife a flight to Atlanta with no flight from Atlanta to OKC which then was cancelled as well. We had to get back home no later than Sunday so we drove down to the airport to find out what was going on. There was a mob of angry people  waiting on 2 employees to try to handle to issues. The employees stated that they had no information as to why all of the cancellations. Later, this issues became a national news story and SW said the cancellations were weather related but strangely, there were no other flights cancelled that day on any other airlines for weather related issues. "
371,"Not Verified |  Our flight going to Chicago, number 3134 on 1/6 2022, 6.25am. The attendant was very rude, my sister is handicapped, she is 69 yrs old. She asked the staff member if someone could put a carry on up above for her. The attendant sarcastically said if its too heavy you should check it in, so another passenger helped us. Our flight coming home was flight 1547, 1/9/22. Our attendants were sarcastic, they rolled their eyes when we asked for 2 drinks. If your employees are not happy they need to get other jobs. When we were at Tampa Airport Southwest counter, it was early but the ladies at the counter were not happy answering my questions. Yes it was 4am but its their job to answer our questions. Just rude, sarcastic and didn't want to be bothered. I am a customer paying for my flights, if they don't want to work early, then don't. I am not happy with how my sister and I were treated. "
372,"✅ Trip Verified | Due to weather my original flight was canceled and rebooked without my knowledge. Then there were multiple delays due to weather. Both I understood and accepted. However, with the chaos my concern now was with my luggage. And that concern was valid, now 5-days into a trip to visit my daughter I still have no clothes other than what I borrow from her. During this time they repeatedly gave me misinformation on where my luggage was and when it would arrive. At one point my luggage never left Texas but they assured me it was on a flight to Baltimore and and they'd call me when it arrived. Well at 6 I called and they said they were offloading it. Called back at 7 and they tell me it never left Texas. Not one time did they call me to tell me any of this or offer any type of apology for apparently lying. I called tonight to ask for the location of my luggage as it was due in today. Now 5-days in and my bag was delayed another day. The service representative tonight again lacked empathy to my situation and offered us a $100 voucher. In what world does a $100 voucher makeup for not having my luggage delivered to me for 6-days in the middle of winter. Of course I took it because it's something and I'm not that prideful but I am very upset. They only say they care, if they cared I wouldn't have to writing this review of how poorly their team treated me throughout this entire process."
373,"✅ Trip Verified | First, we stood in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes before we were able to even get to the counter flying Business Select then another 15 plus minutes to get checked in as the customer service rep looked all around instead of paying attention to what he was doing. It took 5 scans of each of our passports, 2 of us were traveling together. People were moving others to the front of the business line for tips. 1 counter working A List passengers that pay more for expedition to begin with, and we were solicited to tip more to get us to the front of the line. No way! Then we were given a free drink coupon for our flight. Beer, wine or liquor was valid for the day of travel only and only for Southwest Airline, this was rejected by attendant with ""We haven't had alcoholic beverages for over two years now, then he chuckled"". A non alcoholic beverage offering at that time would have been nice, but no offer. We had already had coffee and soda, so maybe one drink allowed. This is the worst experience ever flying. Why should I pay for business class if it does not benefit me. We boarded behind wheelchair passengers and their extended families who miraculously were able to travel walking when landed due to no wheelchairs available yet at the gate. Three of 9 remained seated waiting for assistance. I have no problem waiting for those three, at all. This makes me question if I will ever fly Southwest again, but I will never pay for Business Class again with them, regular boarding took well over 2 hours to check in for the flight. There were at least 5 counters to serve other class boarding. The security process took way less time as they screened everyone's bags and persons. This is an economy type airline, thankfully it was the non-stop destination option. Beware, if you fly with them, keep your money in your pocket and don't bother with A list, business or first class, you just threw away your money."
374,"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest’s customer service is terrible. I paid for early bird check in, when I got to the airport my boarding number was C 47. I upgraded so I wouldn’t be the last one on the plane with the worst seat. So now this has cost $60 and Southwest refuses to give a reimbursement for their error. In Houston it took 45 minutes at baggage claim for the luggage. Overall I will not fly with them if this is how they do business. I am grateful my flight was canceled."
375,"Not Verified |  My comment is on the lack of enforcement of masks. Yes we say it's mandatory but they are not enforcing it properly. As soon as stewardesses walk away people pull mask down all the way or under nose. If your not going to wear a mask properly the entire time don't fly! Stewardesses should be more firm and walking around enforcing mask more. I flew from Texas to Ohio, girl took her mask down during snacks and didn't put it up the rest of the trip. My return flight the man beside me didn't even wear a mask into the airport and didn't wear it the entire trip even after being told multiple times by one step ""thank God"" to put it up and leave it up. This man after the second time should have been fined and or arrested upon departure. But no.. nobody says anything and how many people end up sick?"
376,"✅ Trip Verified | Kansas City to Denver. Horrible experience. Had a direct flight that was held an extra 30 minutes for 5 people to board from connecting flights - after everyone was already boarded. Once we reached Denver, there were no gates available so we waited in a long line of planes for over an hour. I don't understand how this could happen at Denver. It is huge. Never flying Southwest again."
377,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the absolute worst experience of my entire life. I will never fly with southwest again. First of all, the flight attendant showed up super late causing the flight to be delayed. Once we were all boarded and sitting in the seats, the power went out on the plane. We waited and waited and finally it got fixed. Then we pulled onto the runway, and for some reason they pulled us all the way back up to the gate again! Nobody told us what was going on. So we sat at the gate for MORE than 30 minutes and we still don’t know why and then finally we went back to the runway and we took off. Then we landed here at CVG at 12:20am (many hours later than planned) and I'm still sitting here in this plane at 1:02am and they haven't let us off yet - why am I still sitting here in this plane 42 minutes after landing? Why did we not land until after midnight when I have work early in the morning? Because of stupidity. I am floored and very angry. They’ve lost a customer."
378,"Not Verified |  Flight was delayed 2.5 hours when there were planes on the ground not being used. Finally boarded and still delayed because waiting for 3 people that were running late. Landed very late then sat on the ground for another hour waiting for a plane to move from the gate. There were 5 open gates but they wouldn’t let us park there. Instead, we sat on the ground inhaling fumes. No notification from the crew on board as to why. This was mismanagement and someone high up made a small mistake which cascaded to a larger one."
379,"✅ Trip Verified |  This isn’t the first time Southwest has screwed up my luggage. Last time I flew southwest they lost my luggage, and then gave me the wrong luggage. This time they completely damaged my Delsey large luggage, it wasn’t a cheap purchase for me by any means. I understand normal wear and tear on luggage, but this went so far past wear and tear. Customer service does not help and will tell you to simply accept that they damage your property. The only thing that’s nice about Southwest is that their rates are budget but you make up the difference in having to buy new luggage. Fly American Airlines."
380,"✅ Trip Verified |  I left a package on my flight from Boston to Midway. It was an early Christmas gift with instructions not to open until Christmas. I accidentally left it in the above luggage compartment when I deplaned. I only remembered that I left it there when I boarded my flight from Midway to Houston Hobby. I completed a missing items report and spoke with a few flight attendants. They all directed me to fill out the mission items report. Before leaving the airport I stopped at the luggage office and the woman gave me the number to the lost and found offices in Midway and Pittsburgh (where the plane that I left the package on was going to next). I called both offices a few times and the next day a woman in Midway answered and said they had the package. I was so relieved. She offered to mail it to me and needed my FedEx number. I was having trouble with my FedEx account so I needed to hang up with her and then call her back. She was so wonderful and helpful. I can't remember if her name was Courtney or Michelle or something else. Any way, I was extremely grateful for your kindness and her help! Thank you, SW! and thank you in particular to them women in Hobby and Midway who were so helpful!"
381,"Not Verified | I had two flights with this airline - and both of them were direct. I purchased those flights because I have a tight timetable. One of them was at 6:55 in the morning after getting in late at night on another airline. The first flight was cancelled weeks before with NO reasonable rebook options, so I had to fly from MCI to Chicago before heading out west. This one was cancelled immediately beforehand, and then the woman at the counter told us to run, not telling us the gate was at the other end of the airport and not calling them to tell them to wait. After running, losing some of our stuff, I was treated to missing the plane anyway and then being changed to an even later flight on no sleep. Vouchers do not make this right. I won’t be flying Southwest again."
382,"Not Verified | I had a travel voucher from a purchase in Feb 2021. I used them throughout this past year but had some travel voucher $ leftover. I then used that to roll into a new flight that was scheduled to take place in Dec 2021. I had to cancel that trip because I got covid the day before. When I went to use the travel voucher for a trip this Feb 2022, I saw that the two different travel voucher credits expiration dates were rolled up into the original Feb 2021 purchase instead of being separated out from dates or purchases. Very dissatisfied with this treatment. I called southwest to get it straightened out and waited on the phone for over 45 minutes only to hang up because I had to get to my appointment. Had I known I would have to go through all of this with the travel voucher expiration date problem from Southwest and waiting on the phone for help I would have gone with a different airline and airline credit card."
383,"Not Verified |  They were very courteous, helpful and inviting. I had no issues. Everyone and everything from booking and boarding to baggage claim went smooth and I will Definitely continue to use them. 5 out of 5 stars!"
384,"✅ Trip Verified | My half brother who is intellectually challenged asked for help in obtaining his boarding pass this morning at the Orlando (MCO) terminal for Southwest Airlines. He was there at 5:00 am for a 6:45 am flight. He forgot his mask. A Customer Assistant lady told him that he had to get out of line and possibly was going to be thrown out of the airport because he did not have a mask. This is after he politely told them that he forgot his mask and if they could get him a mask. He had to go and purchase a mask. Luckily there was a kind soul in line that provided him with a mask to wear. Needless to say he was petrified that he would miss his flight. Like I instructed him to ask for help with the kiosk to obtain his boarding pass. I have never had any problems in the many years I've flown Southwest Airlines or other airlines in my Air Force career spanning decades. The staff member told him that he had to get his own boarding pass, he had to do manage the kiosk by himself. Anyone that ever meets my half brother automatically is aware that he is intellectually challenged. First of all it is heartless to have this attitude toward intellectually challenged human beings. Secondly what happened at the basic premise of customer service for Southwest Airlines? Did I say heartless! What kind of training is this airline providing to their so called customer service representatives that are in the forefront of this airline? I called Southwest to file a formal complaint. It tells me where Southwest Airlines customer service initiatives are."
385,"✅ Trip Verified |  I left Cancun, Mexico, with a 45 minute lay over at Houston, before heading to my final destination (Phoenix). I got to Houston at 10am. My flight to Phoenix kept getting cancelled from 11:30 am till 6pm. Then Southwest Airlines load us on a flight to San Jose with promises that phoenix will be our last destination that day. The minutes we touched San Jose, we were told our flight to Phoenix was canceled. To top things off. My checked in bag got lost. Had no change of clothes. Southwest decided to put us in a hotel for a night. But did not pay for our meals. They issued new tickets showing from San Jose we would head to Phoenix the next day. Well, without any notice. At boarding time the next day, We were told the flight was going to another destination first. And we did. A trip that should have taken 4 hours took 28 hours. My bag with all my supplies got lost. Other customers bags were wet to the touch in San Jose. Southwest airlines did not see any need to explain why our flight was cancelled so many times. I'm done with this airline. Good luck to those who want to trust Southwest. I will pay and try my luck with better airlines. "
386,"Not Verified | We want to recognize a Southwest Airline Supervisor who helped us in the Orlando Airport on Dec. 1st. My husband had a low blood sugar episode while standing in line to board the plane. I notified the ticket agent who immediately called for a wheelchair. Ildi gave him some orange juice and sat with him while I spoke with another agent who called the paramedics. Ildi was very calm and supportive throughout the episode. She stayed with us the entire time, even after the paramedics checked his vitals. She was extremely professional. I just wanted to let the company know how much we appreciated her kindness and encouragement. She is an excellent representative for your company."
387,"Not Verified |  Southwest is known as a cheap airline, and it deserves this reputation. After waiting in line 25 minutes to add a Frequent Flyer number to my ticket, I was disconnected. It does not even allow you to leave a call back number. I do not ever plan to use them again."
388,"✅ Trip Verified | Not the Southwest they were when they started. They used to talk the talk and walk the walk when it came to customer service, that no longer exists. Customer service is mediocre and incompetent. Processes that could be quick and streamlined easily take a lot of time. Not once were we verified for covid tests, mask wearing inside the aircraft is optional despite it being implemented by law. When you arrive at the Baltimore Airport you need to walk to the other end of the airport with your bags to do the bag transfer and wait in line for people coming into the airport. I can't imagine what that must be like for someone with some form of impediment like the lady I saw dragging her bag walking with a cane. Staff aren't as polite as they used to be either. We are definitely not flying with them again and changing our Chase card from SW to another airline."
389,"✅ Trip Verified |  Literally the worst airline with the worst customer service. Booked a flight for April 2020 but it was the peak of COVID pandemic and all travel had to be canceled. I was not given an option of refund, instead the money was put into my Southwest account for use within 1 year. I work in healthcare and it became nearly impossible to travel anywhere for the year. I tried to make a travel plan by December 2020 just to use the existing funds in my Southwest account but had to cancel last moment again due to increasing COVID cases around December 2020. Again the amount was put back into my Southwest account until it expired and now they’re are offering me a small voucher after all my flight money has been taken. I am so disgusted by the way they handled the refunds during the pandemic. I vow to never board Southwest ever again!"
390,"✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived at 7:52 for an 8:00 flight and got rejected at the gate. Apparently, Southwest has a very strict policy of cutting off boarding 10 minutes before takeoff. We were 2 minutes past their cutoff but they had no mercy during the holiday season. I other airline I have flown will cut you off; if you make it before take off you are good. On top of that, the gate attendant was unkind and cold. I will never fly southwest again and I don’t recommend them to anyone. Silly policies and poor customer service."
391,Not Verified |  The stewards were so rude. We selected to sit by the door for leg room. They asked to respond verbally and my husband responded Si. She yelled at him saying in English! Really! Glared at us whole time. Seats were separated and when we asked is there a way we can sit together we were told to appreciate what we had. On the way back everyone seems grouchy or in a bad mood. Maybe they are over worked because so many lost jobs over vaccine mandates. But for whatever the reason I will never fly with Southwest again. Did not appreciate the treatment on a six hour flight going both ways.
392,"✅ Trip Verified |  Spoke with a reservation agent regarding booking a military flight for four round trip tickets on Dec 12 for Dec 24.-Jan 3.. Was told that paris would not need a seat so we proceeded to talk about purchasing three seats and were asked for our card details so it can be placed on file. After giving our details the gentleman made the purchase without any consent of the purchase being made at that moment or anything. My husband had to look at our account to see that money had been taken after asking the gentleman why would he not notify us he then proceeds to say that he never really took our son into account(put him in the system) and now he need to make a separate purchase because he infants does need a seat and that any 2 and up has to pay for a seat, although in a previous conversation he had said 2 and under. Not once did he apologize for charging our card without approval nor for neglecting to tell us our child did need a seat at the time of purchase when being told originally that he didn’t. We are in the holiday season when tickets can be pricey and I feel that we should’ve been given a option as to which airline would accommodate us better instead our money was taken and now we have to week 7-10 business days to get the money back and by then all the airline seats will be sold out or higher due to this inconvenience. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was switched to a department without briefing them of my case and without any notations being place on my account. And the Supervisor didn’t help either it was either get a refund or pay full price for my sons ticket(a seat that he will not sit in) no discount, no taxes dropped for making me have to do two purchases when being asked if 4 tickets needed to be purchased and/or no comped seat for the child. Completely unprofessional experience and I never intend to fly with this company again. There’s no respect for the customers and they don’t believe in satisfying the customers even when the customers are looking for a resolve."
393,"Not Verified | I was flying from Houston to Florida and had a lay over in New Orleans. Lay over originally was 50mins but then flight got delayed. I land in Tampa and apparently me and several people who had similar lay overs all had luggage left back in New Orleans. The airline couldn't have bothered to transfer our bags on time?  There was ample time and they ruined a weekend trip i planned. Southwest, you need to get your act together and have better policies. Now we are all waiting to get our stuff back. I  will never travel Southwest again. This is just pure laziness and could have been avoided. Thanks for the $200 travel voucher. "
394,✅ Trip Verified |  I have been delayed 3 times on this flight. I was suppose to be in las Vegas at 4:45 pm. Not I’m barely about to board and it’s 6:20pm. This is terrible time management.
395,"Not Verified | My husband and I recently flew Southwest Airlines coming home from a vacation trip. The Southwest Airlines steward, Lloyd, was so attentive and respectful. He offered walking and seat change assistance to an elderly woman on the plane. He also checked on all the passengers several times throughout the flight to make sure everyone was doing okay. Lloyd made the flight enjoyable and comfortable. I will definitely continue to fly with Southwest because of him."
396,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Can’t believe the lack of EQ from Staff. Had to buy a last minute ticket for my 2 year old daughter and 5 year old son. Somehow the boarding passes were split up. So my son was A and me and my daughter were B. So we tried to board in the A group seeing as we would be called up in another 20 or so people. And the man taking tickets refused to let us do so. Very disgusted with his attitude, as he was treating us like shop lifters."
397,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with Southwest Airlines from San Francisco to LA! The flight had a delay of about 3 or 4 hours! The flight attendant gave all the passengers vouchers for about $100. The voucher expired by the end of 2020! The pandemic time! Everywhere was closed and some of the people didn’t feel safe to travel during that time! Now since everything is getting better I called the airline, I asked about extending my voucher, I explained everything, it was a pandemic for all the world not only California! They don’t do it! Why? Because they keep saying we have 6 months policy after the expiration date! It was a pandemic! Such a bad experience 4 hours delay (however this is not irregular for Southwest), no care about customers!"
398,"✅ Trip Verified | Booked fares to Stl from Hou. At midnight Oct 10, received a text saying flight was canceled and to log on to SW to rebook.....no flights available! Called CS and there was a recording stating there was a 120 minute wait. Got rental car to drive back to Hou. SW gives me a $150 voucher? Doesn’t cover even one fare, not to mention the car and fuel! Never again!"
399,"Not Verified |  My friend and I were trying to fly out of Los Angeles (Burbank) to NYC and of course the fog was crazy this particular morning. Burbank ended up canceling every flight (at least in the morning). The lady at one of the kiosks was super helpful. In a very stressful situation (for everyone) was cool, calm, and collected. She was kind and quick when helping us out. I was pleasantly surprised that I felt okay even though it was chaotic."
400,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew Southwest for family vacation to Cancun. We went from GR to Chicago and when boarding started they said first come first serve on seats and we were letter C so we're last to board. Some of us got to sit together to Chicago, once we boarded in Chicago to Cancun again first come first serve we were letter C again . My family was strong put through out the whole airplane . My son has a brain injury and didn't have a clue how to fill out the declaration papers. So you people need to start assigning seats. We all ended up in middle seats and were like sardines  .. for the money we paid should of got better service. No one wants to move or offer a seat because they want an empty seat between them. With my experience I doubt I will fly Southwest again. "
401,Not Verified |  This was our first time ever flying Southwest and it will be our last. Totally disorganized and for the price of our ticket it was a rip-off. We paid $1200 each plus upgraded once not realizing that people can sit in the same area without paying. This was from Nashville to Puerto Vallarta. I have traveled all over the world including on many foreign carriers and have never had an experience even close to this one. Beware!
402,"Not Verified |  Southwest has been getting progressively worse. If I had a problem with one flight once in a while it would be fine, but every time I fly Southwest something happens. They damaged my brand new suitcase. 4 hr delay. 30 minute delay because their attendant was late. A very unprofessional airline. Many of the employees are pretty grumpy. Wouldn't recommend"
403,"Not Verified |  I had the most terrible experience flying with Southwest for the first time. First, I had to deal with security at Baltimore airport, who shook me down over a bottle of hair cream and because of the sparkles on my sweater and missed my first flight, then I was placed on a later flight with Southwest, waiting to get back home to Florida, but waited an entire hour at the airport, due to the flight being delayed and the Southwest staff failing to update us on why we were an hour late leaving the airport. When an explanation was finally provided, we were told that our plane had to be towed, which made no sense, then we were told that we were unable to board, due to a technical issue with the computers. So, we were dealing with a huge, tired and confused group of people, waiting around in the airport, just waiting to go home. Oh and the saga doesn't end there, once we were FINALLY able to board the plane, we had to wait an additional 30 minutes, for no reason. I don't think I will ever fly with Southwest again, I didn't get back to Florida until 10:30pm and still had to drive 45 minutes to where I actually live, from West Palm Beach. "
404,"Not Verified |  Overall, my flight was great. We arrived just in time for boarding, and it was quick and fast. Taxing was surprisingly quick.  Entertainment was easy, you could bring your own handheld device. The website offered a ok selection of movies and tv shows, along with free messaging (iMessage and WhatsApp). Internet costs 8$, but free for A-List Preferred members I believe. Lastly, they had a good selection of Live TV stations and free Iheartradio. The seat width was good for a 2 hour flight, however one concern I would have is food. They only offer a snack mix on the airline, however they do offer a selection of beverages. If you are going on a longer flight, please bring your own food. The landing provided scenic views of the Hoover Dam, the touchdown was a little bumpy. I would recommend Southwest if you want a great experience and cheap fares. And I forgot to mention, be sure to take advantage of their free baggage system! (first 2 bags free)"
405,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst experience flying with Southwest. First they cancel your flight, then the process to rebook is a headache, also don’t forget after they rebook us from our original itinerary to San Diego I have to land at Ontario and have someone drive 4 hours (there and back) to pick me up. Also my luggage is on a completely different flight. Not only that but my other friend is given false tickets since she was left in Long Beach instead of lay over in Oakland and land in San Diego. She lands in Long Beach without luggage as well."
406,"✅ Trip Verified |  SWA Canceled our flight to Vegas 3 hrs before take off (6:30am) via text 11/1/21. We were advised to jump online to re-book, by the time we did there were no flights available. We were meeting friends, pre-paid hotel, had Lionel Ritchie tickets and this was a vacation we had planned 10 months in advance. We never got to go because other airlines same day booking were astronomically high. We missed our concert, vacation and friends because of SWA employee no shows, this was the reason for cancellation. We complained to SWA and their response was a $150 voucher, after losing out over $1500 in hotel fees and concert tickets. Beware of this airline trying to make amends at faults of their own. Their customer relations dept are horrible and would not recommend flying with them ever. "
407,✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely the worst experience I’ve ever had at an airport/with an airline. We got to the airport at 1pm for a 4.35pm departure. We were moved to 3 different lines and eventually at 3.0pm we reached the ticket counter. When we reached the front of the line they then took people behind us that were on a flight that departed 10 minutes before ours. No one knew what was going on and the extra time we wanted to use to get food and other items was now gone and we had to rush to our gate.
408,"Not Verified |  Our flight from Albany to San Antonio on Southwest had us worried after the problems of cancelled flights a few weeks earlier. Also this was our first try at bringing a folding electric wheelchair for use at our destination as well as during the layovers. We could not be happier with the care and help with getting the chair aboard the plane and retrieving it at each destination. The personnel at the check in and the gates at Albany, Baltimore, and San Antonio, were superb. I would recommend Southwest to any traveler and especially passengers that need assistance. Southwest people are the best."
409,"Not Verified |  This has been the worst experience I've ever had with an airline, so many delays. Now I'm on a 2 hour delay from Dallas to Indianapolis and I won't get home until after midnight - unacceptable."
410,"Not Verified |  Continuing saga. After a three plus hour delay at John Wayne Airport and a thirty-six minute flight we get to spend another three hour plus wait in the McCarran airport since the delay caused us to miss our flight to Reno. They assigned us to group C boarding yet we had paid the upgrade to A boarding. When questioned they just said they'll refund our money. A lousy way to end a family trip to Disneyland. With the delay to fly down and back we could have driven and saved the sore arse, back and frustration. JSX or AHA here we come."
411,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have never had such a terrible experience. Multiple delays, missed connections and rude staff. After paying for early boarding, we were bumped down to the C boarding group due to a three hour delay causing us to miss our connection. We phoned Southwest from the airport and they refused to help us. We even asked if we could pay more to be part of group A-15. Due to Southwest issues, I was not able to even sit with my husband. As they say at Southwest “C is for the center seat”. We will never fly Southwest again. We could have driven in half the time it took us to fly. This was not a budget flight paying $450 each for for the trip. Never again!"
412,Not Verified |  I've flown this airline three times and each time there has been a delay of two to three hours each. Often for no reason of why. I've no problem with the crew but have grievous trepidations about the airline organization itself. They claim low cost which is true but they fail to live up to any form of arriving or departing on time. This will be an airline of last resort. Fly at your own risk especially if there is a connecting flight.
413,"✅ Trip Verified |  As I am writing the review now, when my flight is supposed to be already in air and should have been reaching Nashville in an hour. But, I am still sitting with full house flight still at LaGuardia since 6:55pm. And the pilot is waiting for the gas in the flight as we speak! This is very unprofessional. If someone actually have an emergency, I would not suggest Southwest Airlines to anyone. "
414,"Not Verified |  I called customer service before my flight because I was nervous about traveling with my wedding dress. She assured me I could just ask for help from the flight attendants with my dress to make sure it doesn’t get squished in the overhead bin. When I boarded, I asked the flight attendant at the front for help and he laughed at me and told me there’s nothing they can do to help me, and then when I got by the seat I chose, I asked another flight attendant for help and she said the same thing. Horrible experience. They didn’t even act like they cared about getting my expensive wedding dress to my wedding safely. I’m very annoyed and won’t be flying with them again."
415,"✅ Trip Verified |  The lady announced for active duty service member to board along with handicap personnel and when I went to board the other lady stated that I cannot board as an active duty service member unless I'm in uniform. She stated ""I already told you you cannot board active duty military if you are not in uniform"". The Navy is not even allowed to travel I'm any uniform but dress uniform via commercial plane. She was very rude and disrespectful, she rolled her eyes and said under her breath something about ""privileged""."
416,"Not Verified |  I fly domestically and internationally a great deal and use Southwest to get from Sacramento to LAX for international connections and to Orange County to visit family. One of the flight attendants from Sacramento to Burbank was rude and dismissive and actually embarrassed one traveler in front of the rest of us. At Burbank today on the flight back to Sacramento, I went to the counter to pay for a better seating position and the attendant was rude and dismissive. Is this a new policy on the part of Southwest? I have been flying for 65 years all over the world and most other airlines go out of their way to be kind, welcoming and make your journey the most positive experience possible. Why not Southwest?"
417,"Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had flying! After about an hour on route they tell us there is an electrical issue with the plane so we turn back around! Sounds harmless yet already very much inconvenient! Afterwards they take an additional 3 hours to rebook us on another flight that took another 2 hours to get ""gassed"", then proceeded to tell me that if I miss my connecting flight it is my fault! I will never fly with Southwest again! "
418,"✅ Trip Verified | Never have I ever been so poorly treated by Southwest Airlines. My husband and myself were supposed to leave Las Vegas headed back to Indianapolis on Monday Nov 1st at 6am. Instead we got a late email at 7pm October 30, informing us that are flight is cancelled and we won’t be able to fly out until the next day at 9.40 with a layover. Southwest refused to accommodate us with a hotel, food nor a different flight to a city close to Indianapolis. We had just found out we lost our grandmother and couldn’t get home. Instead they offered a 100 love flight voucher as if that would cover another night at the Aria or food and drinks for another full day stay. We had to miss an extra day of work and had to pay an extra day of child care because we had no other way of getting to our children. No way of getting to our family when they needed us the most. Southwest left us with no options and they didn’t care. The service coordinators were unhelpful, I’ve never been so poorly treated in my life. I’d never recommend anyone to fly them ever again. You all should be a ashamed of yourselves. "
419,"Not Verified |  SWA used to be a “cool”, fun airline. On time performance, top notch flight attendants, good planes. Whatever it is that has happened in the past year or so, the service is worse than UA and AA. The flight attendants are very surly. On time device is miserable and the planes are looking very tired. I used to gladly fly SWA - now it has become my last resort."
420,"Not Verified |  Flew into Denver from Dallas, headed to Reno. For the second time in a row the flight was changed to another gate. This time the flight was delayed due to awaiting another aircraft to arrive then waiting another half hour for baggage to arrive from another flight. I made it home one hour late due to SW taking care of 5 customers instead of the others on the full flight. Bye SW. I'm going with American next flight. Choosing dollars over customers is not my type of business to do business."
421,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest has been horrible. For work, I flew from Las Vegas to Dallas for a connecting flight and was suppose to fly to Tampa. The connecting flight got canceled due to ""weather"" which Southwest lied. I was stuck in Dallas airport for two days without any luggage. Southwest could not get me back to Tampa so I had to fly to Atlanta and rent a car for $569.00 to drive back to Tampa. In the process, my Macbook screen was shattered by Southwest and it was in my luggage. Southwest denied the claim because it was past the four hours and they do not do claims on ""electronic equipment"". I couldn't report the damage within four hours because my luggage made it to Tampa without me since Southwest could not get me home. On top of everything, my zipper was broken, lock cut off my suite case and laptop screen broken. Southwest maintained it was ""weather related"" even though no other airline canceled their flights. This trip with Southwest has caused many issues and I will make sure my organization will not use them again."
422,"Not Verified |  Reno-Los Angeles via San Jose, Los Angeles-Reno. As always Southwest is great flying out of Reno. On time and friendly service. Two of the three flights were on a 737-700 but one leg had the 737-800 max. I really liked the max. For the most part almost new, very clean and good leg space. The flights were pretty uneventful which is fine with me. Standard beverage service and bag of pretzels. The return flight out of Los Angeles was a half hour delayed due to weather so really can't complain about that. No beverage service on that flight as turbulence was predicted because of flying through a storm but it never really materialized. Had my own drink and snacks that I brought so no problem. All in all Southwest always delivers when flying in and out of Reno."
423,"Not Verified |  When Southwest Airlines first came out with the early bird special to purchase for early check-in, I thought it was a great idea. However, it sucks or is a scam. Seven times out of seven, I got in the worse boarding positions; only the very first time was I in ""A"" boarding category. My boarding positions were as follows (when I used the early bird check-in): A36, B15, B22, C1, B7, C10, B30. I will no longer purchase the early bird special. as it (clearly) does not check you in early for good boarding positions. Oh, as a side note, the last 3 check-ins I did without the early bird special, when I did it myself, my boarding positions were: A5, A8, A12. In case nobody knows, seat are not assigned, just boarding positions. So when they announce that they are boarding ""A"" passengers to board the plane, then A1-A36 passengers enter the plane first and get the pick of the seat, then B1-B36 and then C1-36. So you can imagine how bad the seats left over were, if you're in the ""B"" and especially the ""C' categories. Don't buy the early bird special, it's not worth the extra money, especially when they cannot even guarantee that you'll be in the ""A"" category at all. I would recommend the airline because it's usually inexpensive, but I would not recommend purchasing the early bird check-in service, because it sucks, or is a scam for additional for nothing!"
424,Not Verified |  My entire plan was derailed because of airline staffing and delays. In the end I was instead flown to LAX and unable to secure transportation without spending 4xs what I had planned to because of the inconvenience. I believe it's fair to have the expectation that companies provide the service that you purchase on time. Safety issues I might understand but poor planning isn't acceptable. Use a different carrier ... bags fly free but you and your bags may to tardy for the party.
425,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience on an airplane ever. I had been flying Southwest loyally for over 10 years. Today we had a flight from Hartford to Baltimore get delayed. In Baltimore I had a connecting flight to Sarasota. I asked the gate attendant if we would be in jeopardy of missing our connection to Sarasota. She said no that flight was also delayed. We arrived in the A wing , ran frantically to the B wing to make our connection. Myself and over 10 other passengers found the door to board closed, plane still there and we were denied access to the plane. Without our knowledge, Southwest changed our flights to a later flight without ever notified us all. They refused to let all of us on the plane that was still sitting there. I paid extra to be in the A group for priority boarding, but my reissued ticket has us in the C group, last people to board. When asked the attendant said it would cost an additional $40. I already paid the $40 on my original ticket and I know from past experience that whenever I changed my reservation I never lost my A status. Because Southwest made the changes, that did not happen. I will never fly them again. Thank you Southwest for sticking a loyal customer in the back of the plane. You denied us all access to our original flight, delayed our original flight, changed our reservation without our notice and stuck us in the back of the plane. Keep your travel voucher Southwest. You mistreated many customers today. I will try your new competitor Avelo which is actually cheaper or Jet Blue from now on. I am also going to cancel my Southwest credit card as you do not value my time and me as a customer."
426,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have now contacted Southwest 3 times with no satisfaction. Five members of my family were stranded in Chicago on their way to Florida due to canceled flights. After 3 days a family member drove to Chicago, 4 hours away to pick them up. Their luggage was returned 10 days later. The compensation for that was 1 $150 voucher. In a response to the canceled flights, the response was basically, it’s not our problem. They were out over $1000 in hotel and food bills plus the cost of loss time for someone to pick them up. Southwest sent a $150 voucher. I guess 5 people are supposed to split that. I am very disappointed with Southwest and their lack of consideration for the people who make this airplane profitable!"
427,"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible business model, if you reserve a flight six months in advance then cancel within a week you cannot get a refund, you are instead offered a credit which can be used to purchase another flight through Southwest Airlines, but only within the next 12 months. You are required to pay a higher price for a ticket to get a refund just in case you need to cancel the flight to actually get your money back. "
428,"Not Verified |  Due to Covid nonsense when we booked a flight in January 2020 we had to cancel. We are getting married Nov 19 2021 and wanted to use our credit to fly for our honeymoon leaving Nov 23rd 2021 and the customer service is so unfair, that she states it expires on Nov 15th and that we can do our honeymoon before the wedding! So basically there’s nothing they can do for us."
429,"Not Verified |  I have flown Southwest for several years but currently looking at other options. The service, dependability, and customer service of the past has dramatically changed and not for the better. I just returned yesterday on a flight from Texas. It is not possible as evidenced by passengers exiting the flight and the time at which passengers are then boarded for cleaning and sanitizing to be completed per their stated protocol. That, and the discarded wrappers in the seat pockets, as well as a sticky substance, splashed on the back of the seat in front of me further validates this. In addition, I have definitely had it with checking in at the very moment possible only to board and find passengers who've already boarded saving seats for others further back in the boarding process, while flight attendants who are very obviously aware do not enforce their own boarding practice. I am extremely weary of being treated like cattle. Most airlines have already eliminated the change fees, the only other perk that Southwest offers that others do not is 2 free checked bags, but even that is barely worth it anymore. I expect that other airlines will soon follow suit, and when that happens, it will be the end of Southwest if they do not improve their current practices. I applied for, and have received the chase sapphire card which will allow me to accrue points that can be used for any of the airlines. In the meantime, I am looking at baggage shipping services as a way to deal with the baggage fees."
430,"✅ Trip Verified | This is to the actual employees who were there and not your CEO who I find a big fat liar! Southwest employees, I know you had some problems weekend before last. I just want to say that my flights on the 15th from Reno to LAX and 16th from LAX to El Paso went so wonderfully. I was traveling with my 1 yr old granddaughter. You guys made it so much easier with her. We were running late due to extra time at security and you actually held up for us while we ran across the terminal. Your staff were amazing and so very nice! Thank you for that! I know times aren’t easy and your working while fighting for your own rights and freedoms, so I just want to say thank you for all your help. We will see you on our flights back the 1st and 2nd of November!"
431,✅ Trip Verified |  Still sitting in the airplane 2 hours after boarding. First hold up was supposedly because extra maintenance checks had to be done for over an clean flights. Second hold up was for weight and balance issues. They were literally moving 5 people around the plane and there were only 10 empty seats total. Then as we are pushing back from the gate the pilot comes on and says he is out of hours. We were 10 ft from the gate and he pulled back up and got off. 20 minutes later a new captain comes on and basically has to start all over. Just got word that they were topping off the gas. How is it you have to top off the gas if we were pushing from the gate 45 minutes ago. Southwest really needs to look at their management and processes. This is definitely a 1 star flight.
432,"✅ Trip Verified |  I cannot believe I trusted Southwest with a short flight. I am beyond frustrated at being delayed twice and hearing multiple people also have experienced this multiple times from Southwest. As an airline company, the one thing to get right is being able to adhere to scheduled times. There are many people who rely on flight times for all sorts of events. I will never fly Southwest again."
433,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ll never fly Southwest again. Booked a flight from Austin to Ontario and had a connection flight in Phoenix. The flight from Austin to Phoenix was delayed an hour and a half. Southwest then rebooked my flight from Phoenix to Ontario on another flight since the delay of the first flight was set to have me miss my original plane out of Phoenix. My original plane I was in group A. Southwest rebooked me and put me in group C as the last person on the plane. I mentioned that I was forced to this plane due to the airline’s own delay and was originally in group A, asking if I could get the same group for the new flight. The airline rep told me I “could if I pay for it.” What terrible customer service. Thanks for the delayed flight and then having me be the last person on the plane with the worst choice in seating on a full flight. You guys screwed up, yet I’m the one that gets the short end of the stick. Didn’t offer any kind of compensation/voucher, was rude, and Not trying to make right on their mistake. I will never use Southwest again. Worst airline ever."
434,"✅ Trip Verified | I purchased my ticket the night before my flight (San Diego to Phoenix). After all the cancellations I felt this was a bad idea, but it’s a 1 hour flight. What could go wrong? Multiple delays. Insane. Southwest wants to keep pocketing money and cancelling flights. Total joke. Will never fly with these clowns again. Thanks for allowing me to be late for my sisters wedding, Southwest. Especially when I could have just made the 5hr drive."
435,"✅ Trip Verified | 3 for 3 in last two months with being late on departure! What used to be a reputable airline is becoming a joke! I booked my flight for Christmas, and it wasn't on Southwest! They are right up there with Spirit Airlines."
436,"Not Verified |  First of all, they cancelled my flight at the last minute, then rescheduled me to a flight with little to no time to react...a flight that took me from Dallas to Nashville to Denver, arriving at 11:45 pm. Ridiculous. We are die hard SWA customers, but we have just about had it. Get your act together SWA!"
437,"Not Verified |  Horrible experience, canceled flight and told me to change my reservation. Attempted, but no flights available. Attempted to call and put on hold for almost 4 hours. Finally hung up and drove rental to destination."
438,"Not Verified |  I have been a long-time customer of Southwest Airlines, beyond satisfied, however, this latest experience was not pleasing at all. I made a reservation to visit my daughter in Los Angeles, CA for the 1st of September (Wednesday). She called me and said not come as she had tested positive for COVID. I immediately cancelled my reservations (Tuesday August 31st) and received a notification that they had been cancelled and the funds would remain for any future flights. That was 8/31/21. I got another email a few days later stating that my reservation had not been done in a timely manner, and that my funds were taken and I would not get a refund and/or credit. I called SWA Customer Service to dispute this and was not given any consideration. I’m 70 years old, on a fixed income and was not pleased with the outcome. I would hate to stop flying SWA, however (I‘ve worked in customer service for over 40 years), and would appreciate being given some satisfaction in this matter. "
439,"Not Verified |  We have flown southwest for many years and have been very satisfied with their service in general. Just this past Sunday, oct. 10th we experienced the first cancellation ever. They were able to rescheduled my husband for a flight out the next day at 10:35am. He had a confirmed doctor's appointment and was able to make it. Not only did southwest rebook him and he made the appointment, but the also worke with him during the process and gave him a voucher for the inconvenience. Once again Southwest did their fine job. I just hope they resolve whatever issues they have and continue to fly safe and on time as they have always done."
440,"Not Verified |  This was the second leg of the trip - ORD/DAL/HOU (Flt 29). Full flight with open seating. The flight attendant who was standing at the forward galley as boarding was almost completed started singing - while her voice was/is good, it is not great. After serenading us, she then began to what amounted to a lecture on how we are all blessed and asked to the passengers to respond in the affirmative. In addition, we were told we were all loved, etc. It had the feel and sound of an evangelical Christian bible meeting. Several passengers passengers around me were shaking their heads in disgust while others were yelling ""Praise Jesus"". Unprofessional, insulting and narcissistic for her to think that we would want to hear her sing or preach. In addition, there is no service of any kind on the DAL/HOU/DAL leg. I do not understand why Southwest is popular - this is nothing more than a bus with wings. I will never purchase a ticket on WN or recommend them. I will stick to the legacy carriers such as American, etc."
441,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest has canceled my flight two times already. They don't send an email out until midnight. Wait times are crazy. Over 3 hours. Me and my family are stuck in Houston Texas and it has cost us over 1000 just for two days. We had to pay for hotel fees and rental car fees at the last minute due to southwest flight cancelation. We weren't offered any type of accommodations, only to rebook and when we do it gets canceled again at midnight."
442,Not Verified |  Never ever flying Southwest again. They cancelled our flight last minute and we were told they can’t fly us home until two days later. When we asked for a hotel they said “all of our hotels are booked.” I demanded to speak with the manager who took 30 mins to come talk to us and acted like it was a big deal to get us a hotel. This airline refused to give us a credit to fly home today through another airline. We asked if they could fly us to somewhere near our home and they simply said “we don’t have anything.” Worst experience and ruined our vacation. Not only did we have to call off of work but we had to spend extra money for food and ubers.
443,"Not Verified |  We had been waiting in line to board the plane for about 15 minutes, the flight attendants were just standing there telling us nothing about what was going on! I kid you not, while in line to board the plane, they cancelled the flight! While we were in line to get on that flight. Even worse, they had already boarded our luggage on the plane and they wouldn’t un-board it! My family was stuck there for HOURS trying to figure out what to do. We ended up having to go on a train for 12 hours and picking up our luggage the next day from the flight they wouldn’t let us on. They flew the luggage but not the people. Apparently the day before our flight a bunch of air control people quit because of the vaccine requirements. There was no reason they couldn’t have cancelled the flight the day before it was supposed to take off. Worse, they won’t give us a refund! They’re offering us credits but we will never be flying with them again. "
444,"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest has quickly become the worst airline. My last two flights I have booked a non stop flight to Phoenix and both times they have switched my flights to having one or two stops. This particular time I received an email at 1am stating my flight has been canceled for no reason. My wife has been on the phone for more then 9 hrs trying to talk to a representative and still no one has answered. At this time news outlets has stated that due to weather and air traffic control was the issue, so I drive to the airport and asked myself. They stated is was due to staffing issues? Why wouldn't they know that at 9pm when I last checked the flight status? When I talked to the ticket agent I was greeted with condescending answers and a attitude. Thanks again Southwest! So they rescheduled my flight - I now leave Tuesday, I have lost 2 days of my vacation, my rental car, and my time from work. As someone who works with the public my time is limited and for Southwest to show no remorse in their actions to help me. I will never fly Southwest again!"
445,✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible customer service. Flight was canceled twelve hours before flight. No flights for two days! Call and they can’t even pick up the phone. I have been a customer for many years and can now say I will never fly Southwest again. Would not recommend this airline.
446,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst Airline on the planet, customer service is horrible, rude people. Had me on hold on the phone for almost 4 hours. I’m beyond furious. Never again Southwest Airlines."
447,Not Verified |  Got a text my flight was canceled with a link to reschedule - went to link and no flights available for 2 days. I do not have medication with me for 2 more days. In a hotel where the bill for two more days will be more than the flight. Meanwhile I have been on hold since 1:05 am and it is now 6:04. Never Have I Experienced with such Irresponsibility. Never will I use Southwest Ever Again.
448,"Not Verified |  Return flight scheduled for 10/9/2021 250. App notification flight delay approximately 1hr. Flight was cancelled. Notified to go to ticket counter. Waiting in line at ticket counter notified had to pickup luggage first prior to obtaining new flight, must retrieve my luggage first. So lost my place in line in order to get my luggage. My luggage came off last thus placing me at the end of line. Look on their website and there are no reservations available for the next day. So made reservations for the next day out of another airport. While holding on the phone. Was on hold over 8 hrs. Thought my reservations for the next day were confirmed. They totally changed my reservations to 2 days after confirmation was received. So again I’m on hold and I should be up in a few hours for what I thought was my new reservation. This is horrible customer service. I am so dissatisfied. What a waste of time and money."
449,"Not Verified |  Oct 9, 2021 flight #2451 departing at 5pm got canceled 3hrs before departure time Re-booked for 8:30pm flight# 1729 and 3 hours before departure time they send a message the flight was canceled too! Customer service are the worse. Very unreliable airline. Will never fly Southwest in my life!"
450,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a round trip flight between Miami and Denver for our Denver vacation. The only reason we booked Southwest was for the nonstop flights. Both flights were cancelled within 30 minutes of the scheduled takeoff. The Miami to Denver flight was rescheduled with a layover, and the Denver to Miami was simply cancelled. Will never fly Southwest again; will never recommend Southwest. Thankfully they provided us with flight vouchers which we will happily never use. Southwest simply isn’t reliable. Do not book if you actually want to get where you are going."
451,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight from Charleston South Carolina to St. Louis was cancelled at the last minute. Was never told why. The lack of information afterwards was completely unacceptable. Could not get anyone to tell us where to get our luggage as it had already been checked. Finally found our luggage at the carousel with no announcement. Will not fly Southwest again.
452,"Not Verified |  No issues from Jacksonville to Houston Hobby, but upon landing I received a text notification my flight to Oklahoma City has been canceled. Agent explained weather has affected flight coming out of Florida. Strange since I also flew out of Florida. She couldn’t get me into OKC until around 10.30 pm via Denver. My flight was scheduled to be in OKC about 12.30 pm. She could however get me to Tulsa earlier. What? I would be on my own from Tulsa. I had no option but to accepted the OKC via Denver route. At 12.25 pm I received a text notification the Denver flight had been canceled. Good grief! Now I’m on a 9.05 pm flight to OKC. Never an offer for any type of financial consideration or compensation even though I asked if SW would cover the rental car cost in Tulsa to get me to OKC. Pitiful customer service! Today, I would not recommend SW due to their lack of excellent customer service and uncaring attitude of ticket counter rep."
453,"✅ Trip Verified |  What has happened to Southwest? I used to love them and tell everyone to use them. Other than one international flight, I have been 100% loyal to them for 18 years. Now I am furious with them. I will be canceling my SWA credit cards, and they have lost me as a loyal customer. The last 10 flights I have been on have been delayed or canceled. And of course, no concessions for the customer. ""Full Service"" desk had 2 attendants and over 100 customers. Over an hour of waiting and I am not pleased. It's time to find a new carrier."
454,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest canceled our flight 14 hours before takeoff. Then re booked us 3 days later! Online site kept giving error to try to rebook. Stayed on hold for 2 hours and then got disconnected. Now all flights full. Had to cancel flights and refund will take at least 30 days. Now having to rent car and drive 22 hours. Will actually cost more with rental, gas, hotel stay, and we lose a day on our house rental plus extra night hotel to come home. Just so very frustrating to have booked flights months ago. Horrible customer service, horrible online process. I will never fly Southwest again!"
455,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest counter staff were rude, arrogant and appeared genuinely uninterested in our situation. We arrived at the airport 3 hours prior to departure to find no available airport parking, the shuttle from the Park-n-Fly dropped us at the wrong terminal, and security was severely backed up. We arrived at the gate 10 mins before departure and they had just closed the door. With both of us out of breath from running, my wife pleaded with them to let us board. The “Customer Service Supervisor” (Gate 10) appeared to relish her authority in refusing to open the door and let us board. She then spent a solid 30 minutes booking us on a flight for the following day. I explained that I could see same day flights available via the SW app and only then did she rebook me on a better itinerary. This is the 2nd bad experience on SW in the past 2 months and pre-Covid, I was an A-List flyer on SW. I’m deeply disappointed in what was once America’s best domestic carrier."
456,"Not Verified |  I am an A list passenger with SW. I purchase the business class for quicker boarding, to insure I’m at the front. More and more these days, people are boarding during the pre-board segment I have noticed. This flight, there are 16 people, with 4 wheelchairs amongst them. That's more people than business class. I think SW should be vetting the pre-board people a little closer. Why am I paying the extra $90-130 for business class?"
457,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have been flying a lot as of lately and 9/10 the flights have been delayed! Air conditioning has not been turned on while sitting on a crowded flight, beverages not offered, it is very disappointing. Unfortunately, this is one of the few airlines that flies into the small airport I need to use but I will not fly Southwest if other airlines are an option!!!"
458,"Not Verified |  Late for no reason. Kept changing the departure time and never told us what was going on or why. After boarding we just sat there for 30 min. No announcement - nothing. Baggage staff took their sweet time putting the bags under the plane, had zero sense of urgency. I had an appointment that I had over an hour and a half of leeway to get to. Thanks. I missed it. I will never fly this airline again."
459,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have liked flying Southwest until this trip. Our first suitcase came out open, yes unzipped along with many others where you could see the clothing inside, and ours was also cut in an 'L' shape. I left my husband and daughter while I went to file a claim. No one was in the baggage service area and when I went to enter to call out another SW employee told me not to enter. Showed this SW employee my issue and she told me to wait the lady would 'know' I was there. I asked how she would know as this person had not notified anyone, there was no doorbell or cameras. She replied the lady would just know. A psychic I guess. While waiting my daughter called hysterical as her lacrosse sticks had not come out with her teammates and the conveyor belt had stopped. When we found it that person was rude as well and stated all sticks come out at over-sized baggage and we should have known that. Guess they forgot to tell our team as all the rest of the lacrosse sticks in lacrosse stick bags like hers did and have never before or again come out in over-sized baggage. Hers was the only stick bag to come out at over-sized luggage and only that one time. When the baggage service lady finally showed up, the two SW employees had to converse first about how I was waiting and not happy, making me wait even longer. When she did finally come over she refused, not once, but several times to fill out a ticket on my issue. She said open and cut luggage was not a valid claim. She outright refused to do anything. It gets better folks, I called SW and was being on hold a very long time. Finally, someone gets on the phone listens to my issues and than proceeded to tell me the people were not SW employees, but employees of BWI and I had to make a claim with BWI. When I pointed out all the employees I was calling about all wore SW uniforms she proceeded to enter my complaint about their rude customer service, but told me I had to do my own for the luggage. I did per her instructions. SW responded to the rude complainant with a letter stating they were sorry I was inconvenienced with a delay in my flight and offered me a SW credit. The luggage complaint they noted as complete without any letter, conversation, funds for new luggage or anything. I filed another complaint to comment on this incorrect form letter and the luggage issue to hear nothing from SW as it is now September with no reply."
460,"✅ Trip Verified |  I trusted Southwest until a flight from Love Field to BWI September 16 2021 arriving 11:15 PM. Within five minutes of deplaning I realized I had left my phone on the plane. Unfortunately I had left the secure area so I could not return to Gate A 10 where the plane was located. I was directed by Southwest personnel to go to the baggage claim office to receive assistance. The three workers at baggage claim were admittedly dealing with a disgruntled employee and stated they could not help me at the time because they were ""too busy"". In fact the supervisor reprimanded me for leaving the phone on the plane and claimed it was my own fault for being so stupid. Despite resistance I insisted that a missing item claim be filed at the office before I departed the airport. I waited at baggage claim until 2:00 AM when an employee reportedly searched the plane only to find no cell phone. When I obtained access to my computer at 3:00 AM that morning I searched FIND MY PHONE, to discover my phone located at the Southwest baggage claim. I returned to the Southwest baggage claim the next morning and I showed them on my computer where my phone was located according to FIND MY PHONE. They told me they did not have my phone and that they could not help me. I then went to the police. They accompanied me to the SOUTHWEST baggage claim. He told me to stay outside the office and push my phone to ring on the FIND MY PHONE app, which I did. The police came out of the office and told me that my phone was in the office. When I went into the office to get my phone one employee verbally attacked me with comments such as ""you were the irresponsible one who lost your phone"" . Furthermore they justified themselves that their job was baggage claim, not lost and found? They would not verify to me where or when the phone had been found."
461,"Not Verified |  Southwest cancelled 2 of my flights in the last month just hours prior to the flight leaving. They blame it on weather. United had no trouble taking us as we had to pay through the nose to fly last minute. I used to sing their praises, not any more. Cost me a small fortune. Cancelling their credit card and never flying them again. Use them if you don't need to get where you are on time or when you want. Hopefully the competition will put them out of business."
462,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with my 11 year old who is on the spectrum takes ADHD medicine and has anxiety! When a gate attendant allowed us to pre-board, another one, right at the time of entry said we shouldn't be pre-boarding and kind of implied that we are abusing the pre-boarding option! Second time from Seattle to Nashville I bought 3 premium tickets and was among the first 5 to board, then I was told that I am carrying more luggage on myself and should consolidate between my son, my mother, who has shoulder pain! What's the point of paying premium money when you have to take their hassle."
463,"Not Verified |  Terrible. Flew my daughter home for a very short visit. Allowed over an hour between connecting flights. Flight out of Portland was delayed over an hour, and instead of holding the connecting flight for 10 minutes, they made everyone take another flight. Now my daughter has to take two more flights to get here, and will be arriving five hours (maybe) late! That's if the other flights are on time! This has happened too many times with Southwest. I have always loved them, but they have clearly gone way downhill. You can no longer count on leaving or arriving when scheduled. I am canceling my credit card with SW and going to a different airline."
464,✅ Trip Verified |  My flight was supposed to leave out of Gate 12 at 7:40 PM flying tonight from San Diego to Reno. At exactly 710 my flight had not boarded and I went to see what the matter was. Apparently they change the gate to a separate terminal without notifying me. I ran to gate eight and made it there by 7:30 PM on the dot plane was already boarded and they would not let me on the plane. Southwest reps did not display any compassion nor help me find a solution. I feel Southwest could’ve done a better job at resolving the matter. Especially since I arrived at The gate a full 10 minutes before it was even supposed to leave. not fair. 
465,"Not Verified |  I have flown SW for over 10 years faithfully. This trip from Aruba on 9-5-21 was the worst flight attendants ever. None of them looked like they wanted to be at work yesterday. The plane wasn’t even full and they only offered drinks once on a four hour flight. I’m also amazed how many people get early boarding since most of the huge adults walked down the jet way without assistance. As someone who always pays extra to get a A seating assignment it’s not fair to us loyal customers. Do you even have documents from their MD with the reason they need to board before those who pay extra! They should have a MD excuse to get on early, these people were all in one group, knew everyone and traveled together. So can I use my BMI of 2 over normal as a reason to get on first in the front 5 rows? Or maybe my A1C level is slightly elevated or that I have to take Lipitor because my cholesterol is high. A passenger had to notify a flight attendant that someone sitting in an aisle seat wasn’t wearing his mask after she walked past him! Seriously? Something needs to done to those passengers who are lying about their need to board before those who pay extra for early bird seating. Medical need to board early should have to be presented at the gate before they board prior those loyal customers earned a companion pass prior to covid!"
466,"✅ Trip Verified |  Forget every positive experience about the Old Southwest, and erase those high reviews. Those days are over, and it's the end of an era. They should change their name to Scrubwest airline, because there is a high percentage your flight this Fall is going to get scrubbed. It will either get canceled, or they will move it to a new time that is often impossible to meet. If you complain by email, they will offer you $150 on another flight. Southwest apparently thinks ""buying out"" customers will work, completely ignores the reality that many of us have only specific times to fly. Plus, that future flight will probably just be canceled too, so what's the point? The brand name has been destroyed. A web search with a timeline of August 2021 or September 2021 will confirm I'm not alone in this experience, and that it's now common to many Southwest fliers."
467,"Not Verified |  I will never be flying on Southwest again! They forgot to fuel the aircraft my first flight so that delayed me 2 hours which then made me miss my other flight, so instead of giving me the next closest flight. They give me the last flight out. Then when I got into that flight which they already messed all of my plans for the day because I was supposed to land @ 10 now I’m still at the airport all day, the flight I’m about to board has something wrong with the plane so I’m now delayed again, I have a hotel room booked which is pointless know because I won’t be there till 2 am. Overall worse experience flying in my life & I’ve been flying for years. Seats are terrible as well. Do not book this airline, front desk workers are terrible at their job as well!"
468,"✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I had a flight booked for $949.90. The flight was scheduled to leave early Monday morning. We discovered it was cancelled around 3am Monday morning. We tried to schedule a different flight from Albany to Orlando but the next flight wasn’t until Wednesday, meaning we would miss 1/3rd of our prepaid Disney vacation. We called southwests customer service but there was a 2 hour wait. We ultimately booked a flight out of Hartford, CT to Orlando. This flight cost $2,844.90 nearly $2000 more than the initial flight. We had to have a family member drive us to Hartford to get the flight. While driving to Hartford we called the southwest customer service number back. I explained the situation and expected them to say they would quickly refund the $2,844.90. To my surprise the person told me I had two options. 1- she could only refund the $949.90 (the cost of the initial flight and I would have to pay the $2,844.90, meaning the vacation would cost me nearly $2000 more than I budgeted or 2- she could book the next flight from Albany to Orlando, two days later (causing my family to miss two days of our prepaid vacation). I asked if I could speak with a supervisor but she said she is a supervisor and she could not refund the $2,844.90. I told her I planned a vacation with my young family a long time ago and the plane having technical difficulties wasn’t my fault, and I had to have a family member take the day off work to drive me to Hartford. She said my only other option was to send a message to the customer service department which would be responded to within 10 days. I told her it was unacceptable, I have to spend time on my family vacation putting in the complaint and not knowing if I’m being charged an additional $2000! After about two weeks I got an email, after asking for a call, and was told I’m not getting refunded the additional charge. Vacation cost $2000 more than expected. "
469,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a roundtrip flight From Colorado Springs to the Las Vegas. For the return flight, my wife and I were kicked off the flight and stranded in Vegas with no way to get home. The flight attendant (I wish I got her badge number) grabbed me by the arm and told me I was harassing the patrons which is 100% untrue. We got pulled aside as we were boarding because I was not wearing a mask, and the manger was called. After I spoke with a manger, I put the mask on and was one of the last ones to be able to board the flight. My wife asked the lady next to her if she would trade seats with me so we could sit next to each other. She told my wife, ""no problem"" even though I was in a middle seat, and as we were passing each other in the isle, I asked her again if she was sure she was ok with switching me seats, and that is when the flight attended grabbed me by the arm and said to get off the flight, and that I was being deboarded for ""harassments"". When I got out of the tunnel, I went to the manger and expressed my concern about my luggage that was under the plane, and at that point he said if I do not get away from him he would call the police and have me arrested. So there we were with no flight home. "
470,"Not Verified |  Worst experience ever. My wife and I were supposed to fly to Denver then LA. We were rerouted to a Dallas then El Paso. No big deal. During flight our mask came down to the end of our nose, mine once, hers once and we were told to keep our mask up. When we landed in El Paso apparently the 2 stewardesses that asked us to keep our mask up went and got one of their superiors. This was the craziest experience of our life. The lady came on the plane and went crazy on us. Threatening us with “throwing us off the plane” making a huge scene, trying to get us to argue with her, which neither of us would do. This went on for about 3 minutes. Then she gets us another mask because I explained that my mask may have come down to the end of my nose because it was cloth. She went crazy again. Said put this mask on I replied ok. “Is this good”. She said don’t argue with me. “I’ll throw you off this plane”. Never seen anyone over 8 years old act like this. We were embarrassed for her. Never again Southwest."
471,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a flight that was delayed 6 times. It started with a boarding time of 4:30 pm by the time we boarded it was after 9:30 pm. While our flight was being delayed 2 other airplanes were also delayed. One was canceled completely. While we sat and waited the 5 hours we sat by Southwest gate. The whole 5 hours there was one lady (Paulette). All I can say is Paulette was by far the best customer service agent I have ever seen in action for that length of the 5 hours. I heard every kind of excuse, lie, complaining and down right ugliness by a lot of the travelers. She never once lost her cool. She was friendly to the worst kind. She was so helpful to anyone she could help (she tried hard for everyone) regardless how rude they were to her. I am not going to say it was a great day it wasn’t. It was a long bad day. Saying all that, Paulette made me believe that no matter the situation we can be great under the worst situation! Thank YOU Paulette."
472,"✅ Trip Verified |  I will start by saying I rode comfortably for the 4 hour flight. The staff on the flight was very courteous as well. Although drinks and food were limited, this is what we have come to expect in a post COVID world. It was after the flight that there were problems. We had to wait an hour and a half for our checked bags to make it to the baggage claim. There was no explanation given other than sorry, the guys in the back getting luggage up here is put of my hands. When you are getting in at midnight and having to work in the morning an extra hour and a half is a big deal."
473,"✅ Trip Verified |  I initially left from Rochester on 8/12 and when checked in was told my bag might not be on the flight, and that I’ll have to possibly go back and get it. Well 8/23 the flight was supposed to depart at 9:45pm. It is now 10:37pm and the plane is just leaving. The delay is due to other passengers bags needing to get on the flight. I think this is sad holding over 60 passengers up, when I was told that I would possibly have to go back to get my luggage. So why were they not told the same. Apologies don’t help when you make plans accordingly and the plane is the reason for delay. Southwest needs to get it together. Several complaints all summer. Oh wait now it’s another 15 minute delay."
474,"Not Verified |  Flight was delayed for over 3 hours originally, when we were finally allowed to board, there was another hour wait until they could locate a pilot. It was then we were informed that instead of having one stop, they added a second stop in AZ with no explanation. Customer service has had us on hold for well over 50 minutes now and the employees have been ridiculously unhelpful. We are then told that the WiFi in the plane does not work so there will be no inflight entertainment. I wouldn’t fly this airline again."
475,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight to Orlando was quick with chips and small shared cup of drink.  My return flight experience was so so below par. They cancelled my 9:30pm from Orlando to Indy just 1 hr to boarding that I already arrived at airport after changing and changing time and I didn't bother and they rebooked me to 7:35am following morning I woke up with my wife and 1 year old and 4 years old girls at 4:30am just to be prepared after leaving to airport they cancelled my flight again and rescheduled me to 11:45. Instead of direct flight they put us on 7hrs 50 minutes, 1 stop flight and I was supposed to resume work. I went to claim my luggage and my bag is damaged."
476,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight got canceled the night before and Southwest decided not to let anyone know until 30 minutes before the flight. The lady at the desk was so rude and said I had to deal with it because the crew was tired and didn’t want to work. I understand that flights get canceled, but let people know ahead of time. My nearest airport is 45 minutes away and now I’m stuck at the airport for almost 24 hours."
477,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve never missed a flight in my entire life until today because when I reported to the gate at 11:45 for a 12:35 flight the associate told me the plane wouldn’t be boarding until 1:30 pm because it was running late so I go get a bite to eat and return at 1:15 the flight had already left. I’ve been flying since I was in diapers and never missed a flight. I can’t count how many times I wouldn’t leave the gate if I was there two hours before the flight. I am a very cautious prompt person. I arrived at this airport almost three hours before scheduled departure and that employee should not gave me that long of a time frame and now I won’t arrive in Dallas until 8:35 instead of 4:35. This just shows the competency and assumption of workers, I get to spend eight hours here in Nashville and it caused my evening business plans to be able to happen."
478,"Not Verified |  Booked 4 one way flights with SWA. Our first flight from TPA-DEN was smooth. Flight on time, service in flight was great. Next flight from DEN to Phoenix was delayed 4 times then canceled. No other flights to PHX were available that and next day so we were put on flight to SLC. We boarded that flight sat in he plane for one hour then flight was canceled. Anyway we got to SLC next day. Lost almost 2 days of our travel, couldn’t get refund for our hotel. I contacted SWA and we got ton of vouchers for future flights, even voucher for lost hotel funds. Yes this experience was unpleasant but SWA did great with contacting us and make it right. I will fly with them without hesitation. This situation happens and I do not harbor any bad feelings towards the airline."
479,Not Verified |  I expected to fly straight to San Diego from SLC but The plane arrived in Denver. I had to get off the plane and ran as fast as I can to the gate. The gate already opened. I was kind of nervous break down.  I bought ticket from SLC to SAN to HNL. Why stopped in Denver?? I dislike Southwest Airlines business. Not very impressive! I will never use Southwest Airlines again!
480,Not Verified |  I am not sure what has happened to Southwest Airlines but they have hit rock bottom! I am A list preferred and have traveled with them for years. The last 4 months have been a nightmare. 4 of my last 6 flights have been over 2 hours late. The other two were not even remotely on time. They keep giving me vouchers but what would I use them for? Those flights would be late as well and the experience would be just as poor. They have a serious issue with having enough crew to make flights. This last flight from Dallas to KC will be my last with them. They are truly the worst.
481,"✅ Trip Verified |  Over the past year and half, my husband and I have flown many times on Southwest, and prior to the Covid pandemic, Southwest was always our airline of choice for domestic flights. The pandemic changed things, quite understandably, and we have had patience in what we know has been a difficult situation. However, the past several flights we have completed with Southwest have definitely taken turns for the worst in terms of customer service, with flights being rescheduled without notification to us, re-routing us to flights that are not non-stop (when our originally booked flights were nonstop), returning us to our home town in the middle of the night (when our originally-purchased itinerary arrived late afternoon), losing our luggage, etc. But this is finally the last straw. We will not be flying Southwest again. In June, my mother passed away. The memorial service is scheduled to take place on August 8th. In July, as soon as the memorial service dates were confirmed, we booked our flights back to Portland from Colorado for the memorial service. Twenty-four hours before our flight time, we checked in, as is the usual routine with Southwest. We were assigned seats. Some hours later, we received the usual emails with reminders for timeliness of arrival to the airport for our flight, mask requirements, etc. Now, less than 8 hours prior to our flight departure time, we checked our flight status to give my family final updates for our arrival time only to find that Southwest has canceled our flight. All other flights from Denver to Portland within the next 24 hours are listed by Southwest as ""Unavailable."" We called the ""Contact Us"" number for Southwest Airlines to try to figure out what we could do to rectify the situation. After sitting on hold for literally 2 hours (with what became an increasingly annoying message about how sorry Southwest was for the delay and that they would be ""right with us, as soon as possible""), we finally gave up and hung up. While sitting on hold, we found and booked a flight on a different airline, at last minute prices with luggage fees, etc. This behavior by Southwest Airlines is profoundly unprofessional and completely unacceptable. It breaches the contract Southwest Airlines entered into with us, as its passengers, of a service they were to provide (transportation from Colorado to Oregon), paid for in advance, with the express understanding that the service would, in fact, be provided. At the very least, timely notice of the inability to provide the service should have been provided, along with an explanation as to why the service was canceled at the last minute with literally no notice to us of the cancellation. No offer of restitution or alternative transportation has been made, and Southwest has refused to provide any sort of customer service (although I'm sure that no one could be paid enough to have to deal with customers treated in such a fashion by their employer). After going on line and reading recent Washington Post (among others) articles, we now see that Southwest has been doing this to its customers for the past several months. They certainly won't be doing it for very much longer, because they will be out of business soon. You cannot treat your customers like this and expect to continue to have any. In a customer-service oriented business such as the passenger airlines are, the death knell for Southwest Airlines is surely tolling."
482,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew 89 times in 2019 and I've been a consistent flier, with advantaged airline miles at 3 airlines. Southwest is easy to book, easy to change, easy to add companions and the two bags thrown in for free really simplify my travel when I bring my e-bike to new cities. It is simple to use, with one glaring exception. I get why they do it, and once you have A-list status with them you can take advantage of it, but the boarding system is embarrassing, complicated, and really cutthroat. Do a bit of research before you do your first flight. Domestically, I will likely only fly other airlines if I absolutely have to. "
483,Not Verified |  I will never fly with Southwest Airlines again. There was no assigned seating so me and my husband sat in separate rows. Snacks were terrible! Staff looked and acted as if they did not want to be there. Delayed flight.
484,"✅ Trip Verified |  Pre-pandemic I was always flying Southwest with my family. I loved the free bags and no extra fees. I always had great customer service too. I used to recommend Southwest to everyone. Well let me tell you, no more! Their service, quality, and customer care has gone down the drain! I finally got to visit my family this summer after a year and a half of not seeing most of them due to the pandemic. Myself and my three boys traveled to our destination via American Airlines. Had no issues there - great service and a nice plane! On the way back, however, I traveled via Southwest. Unbeknownst to me they had changed my nonstop flight to a flight with one stop in Orlando. I found this out when checking on my flight a few days before. Now in their defense, I searched my email and they had notified me of this change back in the beginning of May via an email that I am fairly certain ended up in my promotions folder instead of my inbox or else I would have seen it. The thing that urked me is that they made this change the day after I bought my 3 nonstop tickets. The day after their sale ended, they decided to get rid of a bunch of nonstop flights. How convenient for them... Not so much all of us who booked with them because we wanted a nonstop flight. I was hoping they had one this week that I could change it to, but nope. Checked their website - none. Now mind you, I was traveling alone with three boys. My oldest is 6 and the other two are both under the age of 2 (a 21 month old and a 6 month old). If you are a parent, you understand how difficult this could be. I waited on hold for almost 2 hours just for them to tell me they could refund my tickets, but if I used flight credit it would stay as flight credit (not helpful as they have no nonstop flights on this route anymore). They said they ""temporarily"" got rid of nonstop flights from their schedule. I looked at my options for the week and either the layovers were way too short to make it to the other plane for us or they were long and required even more flight time. Needless to say, I had to keep my flight. By then other airlines were too expensive and Southwest said they could not book us on another airline. I was told this before I even asked so you know a bunch of people must have asked this. I haven't gotten to the worst part yet.. We had a fine first flight to Orlando. A little over two hours. They kept changing the time but ended up boarding on time after all. We made it to Orlando and our stroller was already waiting for us when we got off the plane. Kudos to Orlando people. Flying to Dallas was a different story. We were sitting in the plane an hour before we took off. This was due to the weather, so that, I understand. This was another 2 and a half hour flight as well. My poor kids were doing fairly well despite traveling all day. (Remember, two of them are a young toddler and a baby.) Near the end of the flight while we had been traveling for over 11 hours already one of the flight attendants remarks about the mess we had made (my toddler spilled some chip crumbs on the floor) and said that we would have to clean it up, but she said it in a passive aggressive way and asked if we needed."
485,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve always been pretty happy with Southwest Airlines. I use them a lot and they are typically my airline of choice. Overall, the staff is friendly, and the flights are on time. We recently got delayed in Denver due to severe weather. They comped us $100 vouchers even though they didn’t have to which is very nice. My only criticism is the ticket booth at Las Vegas. The past two times, it’s a bit of a nightmare. There seems to be no sense of urgency to get people through the line, and in both cases, it was very busy, and they had two ticketing booths open and one of the desk clerks kept walking away. Super stressful when you have a flight to make."
486,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew southwest 6 months pregnant with my husband, 11 year old son, and 2 year old daughter returning home to Orlando from Portland Oregon after coming from my mother passing away on 7/30/21. Our flight was scheduled to leave Portland at 2:00pm which was only delayed 30 minutes (no big deal). The lay over was in Denver we get off the plane with 30 minutes to spare before our connecting flight was suppose to take off to find out our flight had been canceled and was not leaving until 6:00am the next morning. We are then told to go wait in the customer service line for 45 minutes to get told we can’t have a partial refund, hotels would not be accommodated, and the flight in the morning would be taking us to Indianapolis then Orlando instead of our original flight which was straight from Denver to Orlando. The customer service representative cut me off and stated that they only had 4 spots on this plane so I needed to tell her if I wanted to be on the plane or not. They told us the flights were canceled due to weather but there was no bad weather in Denver or Orlando. My family and I went to the 3rd floor sat in seats and walked my 2 year old around in the stroller until she fell asleep for exactly 1 hour, no one else slept at all. We were able to leave at 5:30am with a flight going straight to Orlando, I got sick from lack of sleep literally the morning of before we got on the plane, my daughter, husband and son are all sick now but thankfully we made it home the next day by 12:00pm. I think it’s highly unprofessional to drastically change someone’s flight to the next day when they land and then try and make them pay for a hotel. I think had I not been pregnant and had my 2 year old with me, and returning home from a family death it wouldn’t have been as bad but I have no idea what happened to customer service. I will never fly through Denver again ( I know better) and I will never fly southwest again (3rd strike for me)."
487,✅ Trip Verified |  They are so disorganized and can't seem to make a flight on time. No one seems to know anything and they just have you sit on a plane for an hour for luggage due to them causing a previous plane to be late because they chose to argue with a customer about a mask instead of just remove the customer. Therefore screwed up the entire flight and just left us for an hour on a plane for 10 pieces of luggage. Do not fly Southwest.
488,Not Verified |  I had a flight for 9 AM and received a text at 630 that the flight was changed to 1 PM. I changed my shuttle service to leave my home at 10 AM. I am over an hour away from airport. I then get a text at 830 AM stating that my flight departure time changed back to 10AM making it impossible for me to make this flight. Now I can’t fly out until 845 PM. When you make a change you shouldn’t change it back. This is ridiculous. I am so dissatisfied in your service.
489,"✅ Trip Verified |  I won't get in to the fact that their flight attendants no longer seem to take care of passengers like they appreciate the fact that we have a choice and we choose to fly with them. Or that for a family of four it's quite expensive to fly and would be nice to be treated with friendliness. What I am writing about is the fact that they can't seem to figure out flight schedules before publishing them, resulting in my family losing an entire day during a vacation that folks save up for years for. Not their problem, because hey, they can get you on the same flight a day earlier. But what they won't do is pay for a condo reservation that was booked under the pretense that we would be staying that extra day, which is past the point of being refundable. Call customer service you ask?  What a joke. After waiting on hold for over an hour, they direct you to the customer care line, where you get to wait on hold for over four hours just to be told the same thing. And, they aren't even willing to waive the additional cost to switch to a different SW flight! What a fun treat it was when my 64 year old mom who is travelling with us spoke to a Customer Care supervisor because she is so excited about her first trip to Hawaii with her grandkids, only to be met with someone that couldn't have cared less and was not empathetic or willing to help in the least.  Just remember .. you have a choice when spending your hard earned dollars on an airline that won't sell you something that won't exist a month before your trip."
490,"Not Verified |  I am a loyal customer to Southwest Airlines but in the past few years I have noticed a decrease in service. Two weeks ago I flew to Birmingham and on the way back to Orlando my flight was delayed over three hours. Mechanical problems so I understood. Two weeks later and here I am stuck in Vegas my flight is being delayed over four hours. I got off a four hour flight just to find out that I have to sit here four hours before getting on my way to SFO where I have family waiting to drive me up north for my granddaughters wedding. I find it difficult to believe that both my trips with in two weeks just happen to have planes with mechanical or operational failure. Also ever time I reserve a flight it gets changed and they try to route me all over the place. I than have to go in and chose another flight. I realize this is an attempt to fill planes and run more efficiently but it getting old. I have over 200k of miles but I’m asking myself if sticking with SW is worth it. My SW credit card anniversary is in the spring and I may cancel the card and stop using this airline as I am old, travel is difficult enough without all this drama. Once was my favorite airline and the only one I would use."
491,"Not Verified |  My family and I bought Southwest tickets to fly to Mexico in December for my 50th birthday. Prior to flying my father contracted COVID and was also diagnosed with dementia. The hotels also put COVID restrictions into place. We called Southwest and cancelled our flights to which we were given ""Travel Funds"". Fast forward we are taking the family and going on a vacation in December, this year. We tried to book the flights using our travel funds and were told we can not due to them expiring in October. We called customer service and explained the situation and were rudely told we have to wait until they expire and then pay a $100/per ticket fee to reinstate them. We understand paying the fee and requested to pay it now to extend the date. We explained we can not wait until October to book the flights as flights are limited and are already nearly sold out. The customer service rep had zero compassion and stated there was nothing she could do that that was the policy. We asked to speak to a supervisor and were told only contact with them was through email. The email response we received only had a first name and stated there was absolutely nothing that could be done to try and resolve the problem. We called customer service again and once again explained the situation. We again said we would gladly pay the fee now and book the flights. The rep sternly responded that they are not able or willing to do anything to assist. That we would have to take our chances and wait until after October (IF they decide to take the fee and extend the funds!) or just lose all the money. They stated they gave 2 year extensions for travel plans changed due to covid, she then sarcastically stated that we did not fall in that time frame. COVID is out of our control, along with the medical problems of my father. We are not asking for a refund of the money or even asking to have a fee waived to extend the funds. I simply want to book a flight flying the same month I was going to previously! No compassion and no attempt at finding a solution!!! I will not fly Southwest again."
492,"Not Verified | El Paso to Las Vegas. I have never in my life experienced so much disrespect from an airline. The entire flight. Everyone from El Paso to Phoenix to Las Vegas, Every. Single. One of them was rude and disrespectful. I also wear hearing aids. And every time I tried to get help hearing something they were the most unhelpful! Nasty attitudes!"
493,"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest wasted mine and my 2 kids day - 6 hours sitting in Dallas Love Airport. The original flight through Las Vegas was delayed, delayed and then delayed again which resulted in missing my connection. The flight was then rerouted through Denver - delayed, delayed, cancelled. The option given to me was get booked to another city and pay for a hotel in that city (my hotel rooms paid for in Spokane was not able to be utilized my myself and my family and would not be reimbursed) or I can go back home and return the next morning which I did. When I left Spokane and flew back, I was singled out by a Southwest Airlines gate attendant that my bag will not fit in the overhead. I was sitting with my extended family and was not flying out of that gate. In addition, I used this same bag that did fit in the overhead compartment on 2 different legs. She would not listen. I sat back down after measuring it confirming it was larger than was allowed - I did not check it at that point. She came back to me at my seat while I am sitting with family to continue her harassment even though I informed her I am not flying out of that gate. She ended up being that gate attendant so I checked the bag at that point. We boarded the plane (all the passengers) and were informed the plane had a fuel leak last night and was fixed. However, it was not completely repaired we had to deplane. We are going to miss our connection again. Plane was supposed to leave at 6.50 am. I sat here at 8.30 am and Southwest still does not have a resolution. Southwest airlines scheduling of their resources - whether it is personnel shortage or whatever is inexcusable. They have stolen 2 of my vacation days and I have to eat all of the costs and time affiliated with their incompetence. I will not fly Southwest Airlines again."
494,"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly Southwest again. I had the worst experience. I was stuck on the hot plane for over 2 hours with a 1 year old. We weren’t updated. Then after an hour of just sitting on the plane they explained they were having IT issues and we were going to be leaving soon. Fast forward another hour sitting on the freaking hot plane we finally left. While we were sitting on the plane the flight attendants told us to buy the WiFi for $8 or watch the free inflight movies (which weren’t even working). Then upon arrival to our destination we find our stroller was completely broken because they broke our axel. It was explained that it’s considered a fragile item so they don’t cover damages, but then I was told they throw other luggage on top of it (but it’s a fragile item so why would them do that?!). Another Southwest crew member told me next time to bring a cheap stroller so when it gets broken I won’t have to worry about it. I am so disappointed in southwest and there terrible customer service. I will never fly Southwest again."
495,"✅ Trip Verified | The planes are cramped, much smaller than Alaska for example. Flight attendants are rude, do not give you all of the information and do the bare minimum. They act like they’re herding cattle rather than doing customer service. Delayed flights on the first leg of the trip. When we arrived to the tarmac we sat on the plane for 45 mins (still sitting and waiting so who knows how much longer we will be here) waiting for a gate when there were easily 4 without a plane at them within my view from the window. The flight attendants then told the cabin “we are cleared to move to the gate please be seated with seatbelts on.” The plane moved all of 10 feet then we stopped and waited another 15 minutes with no communication from staff. The flight attendants were not helpful in this case. We finally into the gate we were originally planning to go into, so the original plan to find one was bogus. I ran to the next gate and barely made it. When I boarded the next plane, I asked the flight attendant if the flight was full, she said yes. I am now seated on the second flight and the plane is definitely not full (photo below of middle seats empty) We also just heard an announcement that the pilot is still on another flight, not yet landed and doesn’t know he’s going to Seattle (the current plane I'm sitting on). So I ran here, parched and didn’t get a beverage, to sit and wait for the pilot to land and come to this plane. The flight attendants are not truthful or forthcoming with customers. This airline treats its guests disrespectfully, things are not well organized and I won’t fly with them again. Southwest has let flight attendant standards go far too low. Not a respectable airline like Alaska or United."
496,"✅ Trip Verified |  Back in the day, Southwest was the best airline to fly domestically in the states. I do not know what happened. This last trip has been the worst flight experience I have ever encountered. To start my trip, I booked my flights with a longer, 2 hour layover to ensure a slight delay would not hinder my travel. This still was not the case. Southwest changed the gate and plane in Norfolk, resulting in a delay. Next, we boarded and waited for over an hour to just get gas in the plane. Meanwhile, planes scheduled after mine were boarding and taking off, in the original gate my flight was supposed to be. Almost 2 hours later, we took off. I knew I was cutting my layover short at that point, but we were scheduled to arrive with just enough time to spare. I sprinted to my gate, to see my next flight's plane sitting there. The ramp to get on was still connected to the airplane, but no one was there to check me in. I frantically looked around for someone to help me, but no one was in the area. I had to watch my plane leave without me. I then got a text stating they had rescheduled me to the next day in the evening. I went and talked to a Southwest representative, who helped change my flight to earlier in the day, but would not offer any other flights to the surrounding airports in LA for the evening. I requested they compensate and put me in a hotel, as I now had to stay overnight. I was informed that they would not put me in a hotel because they were not responsible for me missing my flight. They blamed the flight control in Norfolk, instead of taking responsibility for being very unorganized, resulting in 9 people missing their flight (to Ontario; there were many more traveling to other places). I talked to another representative to see if I could get a better boarding position, as I had the boarding position B1 prior to them sending my plane off. They had given me C13, which is considerably worse. They would still not compensate me at all. I have been unable to talk to a customer service representative, but if this is how Southwest treats their customers now, I will not be back. I did my research during the extra time I had of sitting in the airport overnight, and apparently Southwest has the highest delayed flights percentage. Two years ago, this was unheard of. Their motto of ""flying the friendly skies"" does not uphold. Its a real shame how far this flight company has fallen."
497,"Not Verified |  Our worst mistake when flying our 12 yr. old grand daughter home was choosing to fly from BWI airport. If the security/TSA staff wasn't rude enough, when arriving at the gate to ask a question took the cake. I approached the ticket/boarding person at the gate to ask about help for my 12 yr. old grand daughter as she is flying unattended , for help putting carry on bag above the seat. I was told when booking this flight she would have assistance, however the person at the gate said she is 12 and doesn't qualify (although was told she did when booking). My anger stems from his opinion suggesting we should pack a lighter bag (not the problem, she's short), or that maybe I should have booked a flight with her. Rude and unwanted advise from a Southwest employee is beyond disrespectful and unprofessional!"
498,Not Verified |  Flight delay 7 hours. Said mechanical issue and plane was in Charleston. Did not keep us updated on the situation. Changed gates and 7 hours later we finally boarded. Landed in Denver and a gate was not available sat another 20 min. Don’t like Southwest anymore.
499,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience with Southwest, flown many times. arrived at the gate in Denver at boarding time, no plane. 40 minutes pass still waiting on plane to arrive, check with the gate agent, flight was diverted to Texas (the flight departed DAL on time) agent said weather, but she also said plane was low on fuel, so they had to refuel going back to TX . Flight was suppose to take off at 635pm MST, finally departed at 1135pm. No communication except text's stating flight was delayed. Then all hell broke loose as Southwest started cancelling 50% of their flights by 800pm, thousands in the airport, lines so long to rebook for other passengers. I was lucky the flight did take off 5 hours later then scheduled. Southwest you have to short of a turnaround on your aircraft, takes 1 flight to mess up your schedule. Word of warning, I knew flying after 3pm at any airport. and this happens. I always take a early morning flight, as the aircraft will depart as its at the gate overnight. What a disaster, will think twice about flying them again. I have never been so frustrated in my life."
500,"✅ Trip Verified |  First time I have ever written a review on an airline. Normally I don’t enjoy flying, but it’s generally tolerable whatever airline I have flown. This was by far the worst experience I have had on any airline. My pregnant wife and I were the last two to board and there were two seats left open on the plane on opposite ends. Frustrating but it was fine. As far as customer service, one of the flight attendants should find a different career. The only part of her job she seemed to enjoy was waking up people who had their mask slip below their nose. Long story short it appears they could care less about making the customers feel comfortable between packing flights to 100% capacity and unhappy flight attendants. I have heard nothing but great things in the past about southwest but maybe this airline changed the priorities after COVID."
501,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked flights for a group of 23. How is it that you would not allow our transfer flight to Houston to wait 10-15 more minutes for us to get off the flight from Las Vegas to return home. If there would have been communication with the flight from Las Vegas - they could have allowed us 23 to get off to head to the gate for our connecting flight instead  - all 23 of us are here in Dallas until 6am. Your staff informed us it was weather related and we could not be comp. To have 23 customers (diabetics, heart patients, expecting mother, etc. with no meds) here is sad with no food or drinks because everything is closed is unsatisfactory. We were the only ones on this flight that was going to IAH.  Take better care of your customers. Not once was I advised via text message that the other delays were weather related. Yes, we did experience weather issues 30 minutes from arriving in Dallas. That would account for our flight arriving after 10pm, this information was provided by our pilot. So again, where is the communication break down? "
502,"Not Verified |  With Southwest, we have had several delays. Excuses for these delays include: Missing pilots, mechanical problems,  swapping planes, storms and we haven’t departed, so more excuses may be coming. Customer service does not exist with this airline. And they do not feel it necessary for an excuse for not talking to customer. No excuses needed in their minds."
503,"Not Verified |  Please save your money and time flying with this Airline. We paid for nonstop flight for 2 ways, then 2 hrs before departure flight we received a text message stated that our flight was delay (we live 1 and a half hour away from the Airport). So they changed our flight from nonstop to transfer for the next day and when we checked the return flight, they also changed it from nonstop to transfer flight. Therefore, we called back to customer relation and customer reservation department on July 15th to talk to one person name Ro and one person name Martin - no one could help us out or gave us any compensation or rebook the straight flight for us. They gave me a really shit show on the phone (also they don’t have the manager or higher position they could transfer me to find the solution lol). I hope the management level can read this review. "
504,"Not Verified |  What happened to Southwest? I’ve been flying with them for 20+ years. They use to be a good airline then we just flew with them. I know COVID was tough on airlines but they were subsidized to stay open by us taxpayers, now that restrictions are lifted they sandbag flights till they can pack them out and if there are a few empty seats there are always stand by. The flight attendants and pilots all seemed unhappy. Every aspect of the experience was like they cut as many corners and saved as much money as they could yet charge extreme prices for tickets. But somehow they just invested a ton of money on all of these new Supermax planes that have safety concerns. Looking for a new airline to fly from now on even though I have a ton of points. I would rather throw them away than fly with them again."
505,"Not Verified |  Will not fly Southwest again. They canceled our flight 2 hours before take off and then stuck us on flight 9 hours later. Nothing but rudeness and indifference from Southwest employees. We also caught Southwest lying about reason for the canceled flight. If you plan on booking with southwest, beware!"
506,"Not Verified |  Southwest cancelled my flight 3 hours in advance and could not rebook another one until the next day, which for a short weekend trip essentially ruined my vacation by subtracting one night from my two night trip. They will not reimburse you for any rebooked flights on other airlines (which are 5x to 10x more expensive when last minute/same day), and they will not reimburse your hotel rooms for the missed night. They have had a mass of last minute flight cancellations summer 2021, and they do nothing whatsoever to compensate you for your ruined trip or travel plans. The % possibility your flight will be cancelled with Southwest is very high. If you have an important trip coming up that cannot be delayed or cancelled, absolutely do not book Southwest. Absolutely terrible cancellation policies and no compensation whatsoever, plus high risk of last minute cancellations. "
507,✅ Trip Verified |  It is so sad. Southwest used to be the one airline you can count on to be on time. Now they have ruined their reputation and are like every other airline. They are consistently delayed and will have you sit on the tarmac. The last 3 flights that I have taken have been delayed. Weather is not an excuse because there has been bad weather every year! So disappointing. There is no reason for me to fly Southwest. I’ll just pick the cheapest flight since all airlines are the same. So disappointing Southwest.
508,Not Verified |  Southwest Airlines really is the worst. They delay providing flight vouchers for so long that by the time they got us ours they aren’t even useable due to the hike in price to fly at the last minute. They keep making mistakes that shorten the credit time and then need 30 business days to email the voucher which still didn’t show up until yesterday. The prices are now too high to use for a wedding in less than 2 weeks so they extended out the ability to use them for Oct even though Kevin works on the base and can’t get another vacation until December.  They used to be great to use but now they are the absolute worst.
509,"✅ Trip Verified |  I thought Alaska was the worst but Southwest has taken the cake. Worst customer service, no follow through and does not take responsibility for there mistakes. Left my luggage behind in Phoenix even though I had to pick up and recheck my luggage, than I was told it would be brought to SLC the next day and they would call me. No call, I called twice for a call back and still no call back seems like they only respond to someone driving up to the airport and confronting them face to face. Will never fly with them again delayed flight, no Wifi, and they forgot our drinks, all that I was ok with, but not taking responsibility for there mistake and not following through on a simple call back I will not forgive. This is now my number one worst airline."
510,Not Verified |  Horrible airline and customer service. My flight was delayed five hours due to a “plane swap”. I won’t get home until 1:00 am and have to get up for work at 4:00 am. Southwest doesn’t care about the customer. Southwest did absolutely nothing for the inconvenience that they caused. I will never fly Southwest for business or pleasure.
511,"Not Verified |  I used to like Southwest Airlines but this trip indicated that they are completely disorganized. We sat for over an hour on the tarmac waiting for a gate on one leg. On another we had to return to the airport to pick up passengers left behind. On another, we sat on the plane for an hour while they sorted luggage. I have spent more time on this trip sitting on the tarmac than flying."
512,"Not Verified |  I was supposed to go to my friend's wedding in South Carolina. My flight was cancelled before I even got to the gate and I get a text telling me that I have a new flight and had to change planes in Nashville, TN. Got to Tennessee and was told that they had no flights going to SC but they could put me on a flight that was going to Chicago, then back to Dallas, then to South Carolina. After sitting on a plane for 9 hours (yes, I could have been in England by then) I was told that the plane would not be continuing on to South Carolina. They told me they had a flight the next day that would go out at 2 pm. I informed them that the wedding would be over before I got there. I then got a ticket to go back home. The flight was supposed to leave at 6.20 pm. After being told one story after another, we were finally on our way to Austin 3 hours later. To this day I still don't know what happened to my suitcase. I spend most of yesterday talking to these people who tried to make it sound like it way my fault that all of this happened. Only one person had the decency to even say they were sorry."
513,"✅ Trip Verified | By far worst experience flying with Southwest. In the last month I have had 2 flights with Southwest. The 1st one was delayed for 5 hours due to computer problems with Southwest’s nationally. 2nd my flight was cancelled 8 hours before the flight was supposed to take off and after checking in. They simply sent an email saying weather problems was the issue in Denver, however it was sunny during the entire duration of the flight day and other airlines were still flying in and out of Denver. Southwest takes 0 accountability and I suggest finding another provider for air travel."
514,"Not Verified |  Worst experience ever with Southwest Airlines. Taxi out to take off, right before take-off supposedly windshield wiper not working. Think you might want to test those before leaving. 20 mins back to gate, maintenance fixes wipers by hitting it with a dead blow hammer. Great mechanics! That’s the good news. Now the bad news, pilot now says he’s timed out on his flight time, mind you this was a scheduled 2.5 hour flight. Maybe we’ll find you a new pilot, but unsure when that will be. Meanwhile a full plane just sits here. Southwest Airlines needs to figure out what they’re doing."
515,Not Verified |  Worst flight ever along with customer care services. I will no longer fly with them. First off don’t board a plane if you aren’t going to take off. Second don’t over book flights. Finally when people tell you that they want a refund or they want another airline just do it: my whole family made it to Atlanta but me. We had tons of plans and I had little time to do it. The most important thing about this trip was to see my Grandpa that is not doing well and guess what Southwest told me? We can book you two days later. I didn’t even get a refund. I will never ever fly with you again.
516,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Southwest Airlines used to have it down, pretty much no problems at all. Now nothing but problems and excuses. They now are basically unable to accommodate the influx of people wanting to travel, so they cancel flights, delay flights and use weather, computers down, etc for their excuse. Unacceptable!"
517,✅ Trip Verified |  I remembered why I don't use these idiots to fly. They can't keep flights on schedule to save their lives and when you travel with a handicapped person schedules are very important. I will never fly them idiots again.
518,"✅ Trip Verified |  No Customer Service. Flight was cancelled via text message 2 hours prior to departure. Could not get a Rep on the phone after holding 2 hours. Im on hold again now hold time 2+ hours and counting. I had to spend extra money that I did not have on hotel, food, and transportation with no verbal assistance at ALL. I was told I could email them with hopes of a response time of weeks! Not Days but weeks. This is just not acceptable. NO one that works for this airlines care about its passengers. After they get your money, that's it. Hope you get to your destination. Take your money elsewhere."
519,"Not Verified |  This airline absolutely sucks. I’ve flown them z4 times recently and every time the flight was late, no explanation, or they cancelled the next leg no explanation. I’m sitting on a SWA plane now in Denver, 50 minutes after scheduled departure time, and we are getting shot from the crew on why the delay and when we will leave l. Very single SWA flight I’ve taken recently has been this messed up. Southwest sucks."
520,"✅ Trip Verified |  First flight out, my suitcase was robbed. Coming home was a nightmare. First flight delayed because they had no one to fly the plane. That meant we missed our connection for the next flight. They paid for a room that night. ( that is a whole other story where they attempted to put us, after we had to complain over and over again) The next day flight canceled after being delayed. Airline refused to pay for our hotel, because they said the flight was canceled due to weather. (Liar) would not still be there if they had someone to fly the plane the day before. Managers are rude and are in need of customer service training. They actually tried to lie to my face, I called them out on it. Booked again for the following day, delayed again. No surprise. Staff was out of control threatening passengers about wearing a face mask. One mother asked for an extra snack for her child, flight attendant rudely said no. Same person came to us, I asked for one for my child as she was in the restroom. Flight attendant was extremely rude about it. She did eventually as I reminded her that she made my child walk to the back of the plane to use the restroom because she would not let her by. Finally landed, then the luggage got stuck. They couldn’t even give us the correct place where to get luggage. This is the short version of what all went on. My advice is don’t fly southwest until they get things in order. I personally would now give them a minus 100 as a score. This saddens me as we always fly southwest. Won’t anymore unless they make things correct. Buyers beware!"
521,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am extremely disappointed with this company. I booked a flight last year, but due to COVID, the trip was cancelled. I booked a flight for myself using my rapid rewards points, which were reimbursed back to my account. I also booked a flight for a friend that was flying with me. Because the flight I booked for them was not in my name (because it was for someone else flying not me), they would not reimburse the several hundred dollar flight back to my credit card. Instead, they reimbursed the credit to the other person directly. Therefore, I was out money, and I couldn't even use the credit. I contacted the business and they refused to work with me even during COVID times. I had a lot of points from when I used to have their credit card, and was going to use them to purchase my ticket. I had just shy of what I needed for a round trip ticket, so I figured I would use all the points and pay the difference. Nope, can't do that either. I had to book the flight there with points and book the flight back with a credit card. So now I have about half of plain ticket worth of points in my account that I can't use because you have to have enough for the entire flight. You can buy points, but it's an astronomical amount for several hundred dollars. No thanks. I fly and travel a lot, and I will not be recommending them to anyone, nor will I fly with them again."
522,"Not Verified |  Our flight leaving Chicago was canceled without reason. We were rebooked automatically for the following day. That would not work for us, so we had to switch from O’Hare to Midway, only to be met with a six hour flight delay. Return flight, kept getting texts saying the flight was delayed. Then it suddenly wasn’t! We landed and had to sit there for over an hour to get off the plane. Horrible experience both directions. Never again."
523,"Not Verified |  Southwest has become the Anti-Customer Airline. Their latest news outlet declared dropping or cancelling 43% of all passenger flights. SW Cancelled my 9 family member fights out of Panama City, Fl. to Kansas City, on June 26th for reasons of light showers in Chicago. They left 1495 people stranded. No vouchers offered as required by law, no offers of aide. They are the worst airlines in the sky. They lie to avoid vouchers by declaring an act of God somewhere in the US. Their CEO should be charged with crimes against humanity."
524,"Not Verified |  I was supposed to go to Chicago yesterday but my flight was canceled. My son is playing baseball outside so the excuse of the weather is dumb, I was on hold for two hours only to be told there is nothing I can do. I spent four hundred extra dollars for a hotel and one hundred on taxi and when I got to the airport I was told there is a cancellation. I received no notice so I have to sit at the airport and pray I get on booked a flight with cancellations. This is my last Southwest flight."
525,"✅ Trip Verified |  Like so many other recent reviewers, I was stranded in Denver due to 'weather'. What was supposed to be a 6 hour travel day (layover included) turned out to be a 24 hour nightmare. The flight from ECP got routed to New Mexico after being told Denver was closed due to a thunderstorm. Fine. We then were stuck waiting on the plane on the ground for over an hour before it was decided we could get off while we waited for the weather to clear. This delay ended up being 5 hours. By the time we got to Denver it was damn near midnight and ofcourse all connecting flights were long gone. At that point, we had to wait in line for nearly 2 hours to speak with a southwest rep regarding what our options were. Meanwhile I was also on hold with southwest to see if I could speak with anyone on the phone. No one ever answered and I hung up after 2 hours. Upon speaking to an agent in the airport I was told that the next flight was at theend of the next day. There would be no credit, refund, hotel accomodations or even a darn blanket for the night. I was left with so many others sleeping on the floor shivering (there were no hotels, rental cars or Ubers available). Absolutely unacceptable. I ended up purchasing a flight with Delta so I could get home the next morning. I know of many other people that did the same thing. I understand that the weather is not necessarily the airline's fault, but their inability to accommodate people that are stranded and offer zero assistance is just not ok."
526,Not Verified |  Southwest use to be my favorite airline and today was my official last flight with them. Constant delays…and now paying for early bird is a joke. Saving seats is common practice and when you say anything you are the problem. The tickets are not cheap and until they change their joke of a seating policy and their constant delays since they have such short windows between planes I will no longer be flying with them. I recently flew with United and it was such a better and more comfortable experience! Southwest terminals are packed and unpleasant. So goodbye Southwest!
527,"Not Verified |  I’m over Southwest! Flight cancelled and now my husband and I can’t get on the same flight. I have medical issues and am not comfortable flying alone but there is nothing they can do. We can’t go the next day as the reason we are going is for a family reunion that we will miss if we wait until the next day to fly. So now we are on two different flights, went from non-stop to flights with plane changes, had to rebook the rental care and pay more. I’m certain this is because of the computer problems they are having but they won’t say why the flights were cancelled. My daughter and her family also got cancelled and now have to be on a flight with stops and be on the plane 2 hours longer with two little kids."
528,"Not Verified |  Booked flight times according to my schedule and needs. SW changed both my departure times, cutting approx 6-8 hours off my trip, cutting into my plans. When I called (2 different times, long wait times before finally getting thru), explained this to rep, was told that I wouldn't be compensated any for this. She wouldn't even ask someone higher about my inconvenience. Tickets were not cheap for this flight."
529,"✅ Trip Verified |  First time out of Long Beach Airport for me. I’m 20 and am traveling with my mom for our usual Summer vacation to to see family. Probably the best crew ever on the LGB to St. Louis flight. Very friendly and absolutely hilarious. This wasn’t your typical Southwest flight with 1 or 2 jokes. The jokes were nonstop throughout the flight. Boarding was back to pre-COVID-procedures. While some find that annoying, I actually preferred that. Any return to some sense of normalcy is a welcome change for me. Flight attendants were, actually smiling throughout the flight! Shocker, right? Glad to see this is typical of Southwest. And even after the pandemic, we got 2 bags free per traveler, on top of an already cheap ticket!! The only downside is that a couple of their aircrafts seem pretty old."
530,"✅ Trip Verified |  Never used to be like this. I always get to the airport early, I arrived for my 10:40A flight 3 hours prior, knowing I was going to get some work done. As the time crept up, 1 text notification of delay. Then, I watch my app like a hawk. No additional notifications as additional three changes are made. They overfilled 2 planes with gas which delayed two gates. Then a gate change, then no gate, no gate for you, then finally another gate change. More delays without notice. Finally an additional text update. I check with customer service, we should be fine, “plenty of time to get on your connection.” 4 hours later, the flight attendant says vaguely “we don’t know if we will make it- if you live in Seattle and want to get off now” mind you, we are all buckled in at this point. No clarity on the subject, just a vague statement. We take off, we land in Denver. Congestion on the tarmac, we sit another ten minutes- Now Miami flight delayed, my hope that they’ve waited for us in the 15-20 minute window we’ve arrived. My boarding pass no longer shows boarding. No longer shows gate number or boarding number. The plane is still at the gate. I go to customer service “the doors are already closed, sorry. We can rebook you for tomorrow.” I’m in tears. Another flight attendant walks up and says we were told we would be rebooked, I tell her not true. She repeats the same vague statement, I tell her they can do better. She persists to argue with me that she was on the flight and heard it - I ignore her. Not good enough. The plane is still at the gate. I get rebooked for the next day. I have to call out tomorrow now, missing a day of work that Southwest won’t compensate me for. Oh but I get $200 in flight vouchers for their crappy airline. They book me at a quality inn. I get the shuttle, major crack in the windshield. No AC. .. it never used to be like this. They didn’t prepare for return volume and it clearly shows. We will book with another airline from now on."
531,"Not Verified |  Southwest has really gone down hill. I can honestly say that Herb Kelleher would be appalled by the customer service of Southwest Airlines today. A reservation got screwed up for my daughter to fly home and did they fix it? Of course not, they say I forfeit my money. So I booked a ticket on AA and sent her home. I will never fly this airline again."
532,"✅ Trip Verified |  They canceled my flight and as soon as they did I went to pick one that same day. They take it into there own hands a decided for me for next day me and my wife not being from Boston we’re staying with family in New Hampshire my father is Ill from cancer and could not get up at 3 in the morning unexpectedly, I paid an Uber 587.00 to get us here. They have done nothing for us and it took literally 2 hours and 15 minutes for them to answer me in the queue after saying estimated wait time 38 minutes.  I have many trips planned I don’t think I’ll ever use Southwest again. People on the plane we’re pushy and irritated with their jobs."
533,"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest is the welfare of airlines! I will never forget the ridiculous night that I had sitting in Baltimore Airport after being delayed for at least 4 different reasons and even boarded on the plane and driven around the tarmac and then after several hours and different excuses, told to get off the plane because the pilot had timed out and the flight is canceled! I sat alone all night in the airport and it should never have happened! Then they offer to fly me home 2 days later? No money and sleep at the airport? The best part is I have been trying to call them for a week and automated says 1 hour wait on hold, so I waited and they picked up and hung up, not one time but 3 times! I will pay more for one of the more reliable airlines. Check Southwest reviews, all similar accounts."
534,"Not Verified |  My son and his family were supposed to fly from Midway to LaGuardia on June 18. At 3AM he received a text that the flight was cancelled. There were no other flights that day. The planned family reunion was ruined. He tried to rebook a flight for later in the summer, only to discover that the number of points needed had doubled. It would be fair for Southwest to allow him to rebook for the same number of points, but they have not made that option available."
535,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline ever! They can cancel flight couple hours before flight, boarding system is crazy, always not enough employees and line is huge. What the heck is wrong with them?"
536,"✅ Trip Verified |  This trip has been awful. I am a college student and have summer classes I am traveling to. I booked my flight so that I would have enough time to get to my lodging location and finish a little homework before going to bed. When I arrived for my connecting I found out that my flight was canceled and I was not able to change the ""rebooked"" flight they had given me. The only reason they gave me for canceling the flight is the weather. There is no weather at my connection point or my destination. There is no weather between.  They would not give me a voucher for food or a hotel stating they don't do that for weather delays. I am now stuck at my connecting point for 8 hours waiting for the next flight to the destination. The airport I am stuck at does not have wifi and I have to use my hotspot that costs me money. Southwest would not let me change my destination, cancel with a refund, or change flight providers. When talking with the ticketing agent she also told me there is a high possibility that the ""rebooked"" flight will be canceled too. That means I will be at the airport until tomorrow with no voucher for a hotel, food, or wifi to do my homework. Southwest has used the ""WEATHER"" as an excuse so they don't have to give vouchers. There is no weather so don't say the cancelation is due to weather. They need to own up to the real issue. I am extremely fed up and will not be flying with them again if I have a choice."
537,"✅ Trip Verified | If I could title this review it would be ""30hrs in hell"". Not just one flight but every flight we had on our quick turnaround from Nashville to Bozeman was delayed, rescheduled, gates changed, lengthy waits in planes for gates, stranding in Denver overnight, just to mention a few. But my main focus here is how horribly we were treated by Southwest staff, mainly on the ground, officious in the air. They delayed us at every turn, every time we needed information or to interact with gate agents, information desk agents, even baggage agents, it was the same thing, huffs, rolled eyes, indifference even intentional misdirection. They all were rude beyond belief, lacked any empathy for my wife who was hobbling on a broken foot, no one took any responsibility for anything or offered any help. What was crazy about this was, while I hadn't flown in a few years as I'm partially retired, I flew hundreds of times on Southwest going back into the 80s and the had always been the happiest and most helpful crews and staff of any airline. Now, the wait time to get them on the phone is always ""120 minutes"", everyone was unnecessarily rude (as if there was any degree of necessary rudeness) and to a person, exuded the feeling that you were an inconvenience and not customer. I hope never to fly again and have no problem with this now horrible airline going out of business."
538,"✅ Trip Verified | First, we boarded the plane late due to a maintenance issue. Then, we sat on the tarmac for an hour before the crew announced they couldn’t fix the issue so we’d have to exit the plane, luggage and all. We were told to just wait for an update. The plane didn’t leave until 5 hours after the original departure date. Due to the delay we missed our connecting flight. Southwest booked us for an evening flight, forcing us to stay another 5 hours in another airport terminal. (They wouldn’t put us on an earlier flight.) We are arriving so late that we are missing our last train home and will have to book a hotel. In sum, we were supposed to arrive at our destination at 11.30am, and will now be arriving at 10pm. Next time, I will pay extra money for a more reliable airline, because the 10.5 hours wasted and hotel add up to more than what a pricier ticket would have been."
539,"✅ Trip Verified |  To say my last experience with Southwest was a disaster would be an understatement! It all started from day one to the very end. Beyond disappointed! To start, my flight to Long Island was supposed to be Friday at 5.45 am out of San Antonio, TX. I made sure to check in exactly 24 hours prior, as I always have, and got my confirmation and boarding pass. Then, that very same night, the day before I'm supposed to leave, I get an email from Southwest saying my flight has been changed to the following day, more than 24 hours later than my flight, due to a disruption in my itinerary? So, while I'm panicking because I needed to be in Long Island by Friday, not Saturday, I decided I was going to just show up and play dumb! So, I did! Once I arrived there, I had to talk with the customer service team due to receiving an error at the ticketing kiosk (because they changed my flight, of course). I was asked ""Umm...did you change your flight?!"" Yes, yes I did and just decided to show up a day prior! Not! So, I very politely said, ""No, I had not."" They accommodated thank goodness but, I had to fly out an hour later than expected. Okay, whatever, fine. Then comes the following Tuesday. I had this feeling in the pit of my stomach just knowing something bad was going to happen. First off, my flight from Long Island to Orlando got delayed two hours due to ""computers going down and there being nothing they can do"". Once I got on the plane, they then had us sit on the plane for 30-45 minutes because ""the plane is too heavy and they were trying to figure out numbers"". Okay, great. Now I'm starting to panic. Not to mention, while all of these delays are happening, I'm terrified I'm going to miss my other flights. I was originally supposed to be home at approximately 6pm but, due to all of the changes and issues, I got home close to 1am the next day! Another flight told us that ""they didn't have any flight attendants for the flight"" and it, too, got delayed another few hours. Just beyond livid with the way everything was handled! And, not to mention, since I got back to the San Antonio airport the next day (at 1am), I got charged $20 more for parking my car there an extra day. I just do not recommend using them going forward! They do not have anything in order and everything was in complete disarray. I will be using United or Delta going forward because, even as one of the flight attendants said to a plane full of upset people, and I quote, ""at least they (United Airlines and Delta won't be late for your flights"". So, not only was an entire day wasted for me with frustration and disappointment, I also am out more money than I anticipated because of how much later my flight was. Run! Do not use Southwest Airlines!"
540,"Not Verified |  Today we were supposed to fly out for our girls trip, they over booked the flight and tried to leave one of our friends off the flight. We had booked this trip way back in February, one month ago they emailed moving our flight up from departing at 12.50 to 11.25 today June 17th, 2021 and no actions had need to be taken. Let’s put the icing on the cake, the customer service rep was very rude and told us they weren't going to accommodate us if some people didn’t get on the plane. I’ve never had this experience with them and at this point I would never fly again with them due to the way they were talking."
541,"Not Verified |  My husband was to fly out Wed, June 16th, 2021 around 4pm. He got a notification his flight had been moved to 655pm. He drove 3 hours to Nashville, Tn, got there and the flight was bumped to after 10pm. He's traveling to help his 76 year old Dad during his surgery tomorrow, June 17th in the morning and is also responsible for he 75 year old Mom with Dementia. There is no family left in Austin, Tx that can help. After arriving he discovered that none of the flights on SouthWest today to Austin may fly. Reason given. No crew! Seriously? This is why I never fly anymore. I'll drive across country before flying. Now they have our money, my husband is stuck 3 hours from home, and his parents are in a terrible position. Southwest you should be truly ashamed. "
542,Not Verified |  Worst flight and customer service. Lost 8 hours. Plus had to pay for food. They gave me a $100 voucher. Last night I went to purchase more airfare. In October I have a flight. I went to use the voucher but it expires in September. Its currently June. I paid for the airfare so I had the flight during their 50%off. It was $850. I was on the phone for over 3 hours to use the voucher. Two agents said they cannot attach the $100 voucher whatsoever. But I can have it extended for another flight later on. I then canceled and found different airline same flight details for $50 cheaper. This is an absolute nightmare go elsewhere if you value your time. They have no customer service and will put you through loopholes. They do not value their customers and will not make it right. They just prolonged the inevitable. I have never been treated like this. It was easier to cancel the flight I had just booked than to resolve $100 voucher on a fake 50% off sale
543,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight 2 hours delayed no explanation. Acquired early bird preferred seating (B4), (tall), front seat, had to go middle of plane for o/h baggage, everyone uses front storage, so they don't have to walk w/luggage, passed out small bag of pretzels and 3 oz of water. 2 dogs on flight, unchanged 2 year old. Flight attendants were at the front of the plane on their phones, never walked through the plane once. No bathroom protocol. Fought my way back to o/h baggage after landing. Terrible customer service."
544,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed 2 hours due to systems failure. Understandable. We asked before boarding the first leg of our flight if the plane was going to continue on to Denver and we were assured it would. We booked the flight because we didn’t need to change planes, Got to Long Beach where we waited for the passengers to board when an announcement was made that the plane is being terminated/which meant they were using it to take passengers somewhere else due to all the canceled flights from the technological issues of the day. Flight crew told us to get off the plane. While waiting in line to find out what was going on, I noticed the flight crew lining up to get on another plane right next to our plane and I asked them if they were going to Denver and they all confirmed they were. Southwest decided to board a plane right next to our plane ( that was supposed to continue to Denver) with a full group of people and did not allow us to board. In other words, they backhandedly gave our seats away, boarded the crew but not us as we waited on line and took off without us. Of course when we finally got to an agent, she was showing us on the flight that we should have been on and had a challenge rerouting us for a flight and another 3 hour wait. Attached is my ticket which appears we left at 4:22 like we were supposed to. I also included the new ticket which of course was delayed. Our seats were given away right before our eyes without so much as an explanation or request from Southwest. This was my favorite airline but with this and the condescending way they threaten you to wear a face mask or face civil consequences has taken this airline from the fun comical way they used to conduct business, which is needed at this time in the world, to an airline of demands and consequences. This is worthy of compensation. We did not give up our seats, they were taken from us."
545,"✅ Trip Verified |  While boarding the plane, at 6:40pm on 5/27/21, flight#520/1404, I was sent back to customer service, as the boarding pass I was given by customer service had security restrictions in error. Customer Service Manager, Sally , # 104647 was very rude ""it is not my fault you did not receive the correct boarding pass."" She initially refused to give her name and ID number and she also did not apologize or accommodate me for the confusion and also the embarrassment the airline caused me. Due to this error, I almost missed my flight #520/1404 While boarding plane at 7:00 pm, due to an employee error, one of the flight attendants made an inappropriate comment of a sexual harassment nature that was offensive; and he did not apologize, as that would admit his guilt. He also blocked the rear of the plane with his arms and legs to prevent me from sitting in the rear of the plane. It appears Southwest is hiring Managers with terrible customer service skills and employees with lack of training on ethic and no respect."
546,"Not Verified |  Southwest has the worst customer service I have ever come across. I was calling to try and figure out why my travel credits were set to expire in July 2020. I was on hold for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Then the agent picks up and in 30 seconds she tells me that there is nothing she can do because the flight was canceled a week after the completely arbitrary deadline of September 7th 2020. I canceled the ticket as soon as I could, but it was for a wedding that ended up being canceled due to covid. There are still covid restrictions in place in many places in the US yet these tickets are still expiring. Southwest just stole $500 from me, and as I am looking through other reviews it seems that this is all too common a practice for this airline."
547,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest Airlines had a computer glitch that caused many delays and upset people, We happened to be some of those people affected. While flying home from Nashville our flight was delayed 2 hours, we switched to a different flight that had a stop over but was still due to get us to Midway airport 2hrs sooner. After switching, the flight ended up also being delayed and we would have been stuck in St Louis because the connecting flight would be missed. In the meantime the flight we switched from booked up, so we couldn't switch back. So we were going to be stuck over nite in St Louis or Nashville. I was told to call customer relations to see if we could be reimbursed for our room, there was a 120 min on hold wait. We went back to the counter and one if the very nice service reps got a supervisor to help us, her name is Melissa (on 6/15/21 @ 6:30pm). She was amazing, polite and professional, as was the service rep who also assisted (I wish I had his name!) in making a horribly frustrating situation into a pleasant experience. It was very stressful with having two kids along, My stress level was high and my tone was a bit sharp, instead of them taking offense, they were very understanding and apologetic. They helped us resolve the issue by getting us on a flight that would avoid an overnite delay. After this experience I will always fly with Southwest. Big-big thank you to Melissa and her staff for making the final day of our trip a great one!"
548,"✅ Trip Verified |  This airline cost me a lot of money by causing me to miss my international flight. Their system was down for many hours so we missed our flight to Iceland and had to stay overnight in Seattle. Not only they did not address our issues, but many of their personnel were also rude. What kind of airline is not able to fix their computer system on time in Silicon Valley? The answer is Southwest. They caused many passengers who were traveling from Southern Ca sit in the airplane for 7 hours or more to get to the destination in Seattle. You get what you pay for. Cheap airline and incompetent personnel. If I could give negative stars, they would get -5. We could not even use the internet on the flight and had no hot beverage (could only offer soda or room temperature water)."
549,"✅ Trip Verified |  We were traveling Philly to Reno, Nevada, last night, and there was a computer glitch in Southwest's equipment which resulted in our landing in Denver at 8:30-ish, but not able to deplane for approximately 90 minutes. We were updated by the crew as frequently as they knew something, and when we were able to enter the airport, our connecting flight was just a few gates from where we entered. The next leg was uneventful, and we landed in Reno later than we had hoped, but without any further incident. Things happen, especially these days, but the crew and our plane full of passengers deserve a shout-out for their patience and good humor in the face of our little delay."
550,✅ Trip Verified | Delayed by a towed plane already here in Denver. Scheduled to leave at 05.30 and still waiting to board at 05.38. No excuse for not having the towed plane here before our boarding time. Shame on you Southwest. I thought Frontier was bad.
551,"Not Verified |  Rapid reward flier and I usually love southwest but on this occasion, flight was already 2 hours late due to weather. Plane lands, we board quickly, and the pilot is all set to go - we sit! Nothing to do with weather or plane but rather an administrative screw up. Apparently, we are waiting for a document from dispatch in Dallas. ( we’re in Detroit mind you) No one can find the document so Southwest and only Southwest dispatch has already added 45 minutes of sitting to scheduled flight time. It’s seriously unbelievable - inability to manage their own internal paperwork process!"
552,"Not Verified |  I will never fly Southwest ever again. First off, it's a first come first serve airline so if you don't get there in time you're out of luck on your seat and get funneled to the back or the worst choices because everyone grabbed seats already. Good luck if you're traveling with family. I saw a mother flying on her own with 6 children waiting for the moment they called for her section only to get up there and be rudely told by the attendant she has to go to CSA to check in her stroller. She basically got pushed to the back of the plane and was split up from her kids who at most had the oldest being 7. Secondly the staff are rude, pushy and it seems every flight attendant is standing ready to nun-chuck anyone into oblivion that so much as lets a tiny bit of their mask slip down. I did not appreciate the threats from flight attendants about mask mandates, nor did I appreciate the poor quality and service during the flight. Trust me, pay the extra to get on something else."
553,"Not Verified |  I’m never flying with Southwest again. Southwest canceled 1 of my 2 flights and didn’t ask or notify me about it. This morning I went to my email to check in for my flight just to see an email that had been sent at 1am in the morning that it was canceled. I bought this ticket over a week ago. I was confused so I called and was on hold for an hour, no call back option was super annoying. Soon a lady talked with me and I told her my situation and how I needed to fly out that date and how important it was to me. She then proceeded to tell me it was my fault for putting a wrong name on my ticket (which I didn’t) and then said they wouldn’t compensate me at all or give me my original flight back. But she would charge me a significant amount more for a flight on a different day. This ruins my entire week and puts such a burden on me. Southwest has the worst customer service and they don’t care about you as a customer at all from my experience. I will not be flying with them again and I recommend you shouldn’t either. I'm sticking with Alaska because they actually care to help solve your problems and are friendly."
554,"Not Verified |  I need to continue to lower my expectations for Southwest Airlines. Always providing the minimum amount needed and don’t seem to care about customer service. Airport check in was easy, flight was late, taxiing in was late because the flight was late. Baggage was extremely late. Generally the staff all seemed annoyed at you except for the captain from check-in to the flight attendants to baggage. I’m trying to avoid flying them in the future. Alaska please think about expanding to Denver. Flyers would like better options."
555,"Not Verified |  I raced to my connecting flight at Atlanta airport. My seat was sold to another, because I arrived on time. I was told it was my fault that my seat was sold to another leaving me embarrassed, spending more money to re-schedule my hotel and car rental, and then criticized in front of strangers for being late/on time to my flight. My name nor flight was never released on the overhead speakers. My experience that I will share with my family, friends, and most importantly the colleagues from my office advising me not to fly Southwest - money is the only thing Southwest acknowledges or cares about. Southwest's name makes me sick to my core. Only more money from customers who missed their flights, or will pay additional funds to take someones seat is more important than a paying customer. A supervisor came out to speak to my husband and I about the Southwest attendant speaking rude to us to another couple. The supervisor blamed me for being on time to my flight giving Southwest permission to give my seat away making it okay for the attendant to speak about me to this other couple. The reasoning for allowing the rudeness is because I was on time to my flight therefore making any rude comments from a staff member acceptable. I am in my mid-30's and will ensure I never fly Southwest or speak kindly of the company. The company only cares about money and not the future. Keep my well earned money, because it's too little to amount to the future wealth you could have had. My word of mouth will forever be negative towards this airline and staff for being rude and inconsiderate to a person paying for their service. I regret not cancelling my flight with Southwest after several colleagues suggested I change airlines. It was my waste of money to give Southwest a chance."
556,"Not Verified |  This is hands down the worst company I have ever interacted with. I flew a connecting flight which they changed on me. The flight was 15 minutes late arriving to our layover. A flight that was on time. My wife ran ahead of me to get to our flight. When she got there she was informed our seats had already been given away. She was in the gate area but waiting for me to catch up. Our seats were given away 10 minutes after they started boarding as were several other people. The attendant then ignored everyone trying to figure out how their tickets were given away before the plane was finished boarding. To the point where she then stated it was past their 10 minutes before departure rule, which states you need to be in the gate area not right at your gate, there was no final boarding call because they had already overcrowded the plane. The plane was so overbooked the people you sold other peoples tickets too had to come back off because there was nowhere to sit. Whoever manages your Southwest Airline employee's at Atlanta international airport is joke and has no mental comprehension of what their job is let alone to be in charge. I feel this company can not operate with any form of intelligence as clearly it shows in your reviews. I suppose I am some what to blame for waiting until after experiencing your uselessness as a company to read the reviews written about your company."
557,"Not Verified |  Extremely disappointed in the promptness of this airline. We were initially excited that there was now a direct flight to Destin/Fort Walton from Milwaukee. In fact, this was the inaugural flight! What started with optimism quickly faded to the “same old same old” disappointment. Our flight was delayed for one hour after the gate attendant said “don’t worry, you’ll still arrive at the same time.” That of course turned out to be false. I am actually writing this review from the plane as we speak - still sitting on the tarmac, 40 minutes after landing with three small children. If you have somewhere you need to be or are traveling with small children, I would highly recommend choosing a different airline."
558,"✅ Trip Verified | Will never fly with this airline again. Didn’t know they had “open seating,” which means that people walk on and sit wherever they please. Which is great for the people with money who can afford to upgrade to the first seating class. Not great for single parents or other families who can’t, because of you are in group C to board, you are almost guaranteed to be separated from your kids/rest of your family. As a single parent, I was furious that my kids and I were scattered throughout the plane and forced to sit next to strangers instead of as a family. The reason I was given was “they haven’t assigned seating in 50 years.” So, that makes it right? No. It doesn’t. We didn’t even get cabin service on the flights and everyone is crammed together like sardines. Lowered the tray tables so I could use it for other things and it was filthy - had crumbs and all, clearly wasn’t cleaned. Absolutely awful experience. Will fly any other airline but theirs."
559,"Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible customer service - they indicate families with little ones can board early but we were still behind 60 passengers. While on the flight we were told our car seat was not acceptable so lap seating was ok. Then another rude male flight attendant scolded us and threatened to stop the flight if we didn’t get our 2 year old in a seat faster. I tried to explain we were told otherwise as I was placing him in a seat and not trying to cause issues. He was extremely condescending asking me multiple times his age when I had already told him he was 2. If we were refusing to comply, I’d understand his demeanor, however, that was not the case. No WiFi on the flight. Our return flight situation was an utter nightmare. The website kicked me out several times while trying to change our flights as we had a family situation. We paid the additional fee to change the flight but it was the wrong date when it kicked us to the homepage. My fault. I get it. However, the customer service agent was uncaring and charged us another $1k to rebook. They kept reiterating their policy over and over. They refused to assist us and gave us absolutely no break - told us the flight was not booked so our chances of an early boarding pass was probable. Not the case - did I mention I was on hold for nearly 3 hours to speak to someone? We’ll never fly Southwest ever again and stick to Delta, which, has always been spectacular. I’ve worked in the travel industry for 20 years and have never experienced this level of unfriendly service or lack of service."
560,"Not Verified |  This review is of the gate agent at Chicago Midway A4b on the evening of 6/10/21. This gentleman was the rudest, most uncaring person I've ever encountered on any airline. Was very abrupt, unhelping, uncaring individual. He was short with handicapped people, rude to other customers including us twice. He should be reminded that even though Southwest signs his paycheck, the traveling public actually pays him. I am not looking for anything from Southwest just frustrated that this guys attitude left us with a bad taste in our mouth from a trip that was otherwise fantastic. "
561,"✅ Trip Verified | Flying Charleston to Baltimore was fine. In Baltimore was notified 2.50pm departure delayed until 4pm for no apparent reason. Then delayed to 4.30pm. It's now 4.30pm and still not boarded. Excuse, no pilot. How do you not have a pilot for a flight leaving at 4.30pm that was supposed to leave at 2.50pm? Lost my car rental because of the delay. So no way to get around while I'm supposed to be working. Asked clerk at boarding counter a simple question and she snapped my head off and wouldn't give me her name."
562,"✅ Trip Verified | I used to love Southwest! Man, have they gone downhill. Let me preface my review that the pilots were amazing. Most of the stewards/stewardesses were obnoxious. They make every excuse to not provide food and beverage services. Checking in was an absolute nightmare! There was one staff member trying to direct hundreds of people, and he had no idea what he was doing! We arrived two hours early on our return flight and almost missed it because checking baggage was so disorganized! Will find another airline and hope they are better. One steward made the comment, ""It's time for us to get back to making money. The flight is full so don't protect seats."" Seriously?! There's a better way to convey that info! All of our flights were late, the second one by nearly two hours. My brand new luggage received a big ding to boot! Inexcusable!"
563,"Not Verified |  Southwest lacks courtesy commonly practiced by a multitude of airlines. Canceling flights with short notice, sending serial text messages that confuse any intelligence. Attendants unable to enlighten customers where their luggage disappeared the day before and where can it be found the next day. An outstandingly negative overall experience."
564,✅ Trip Verified | Southwest Airlines has taken a nose dive and crashed and burned over the past 6 months. Their customer service is a joke with 90 + min wait times. I've flown 23 times with them this year and half of the flights have had major issues. I have had 3 delays over 7 hours. 3 cancelled flights. No way to get anyone on the phone with 90 min wait times. I've flown SWA religiously for 13 years and will never fly them again. I cannot handle the delays and lack of customer service any longer. Avoid this airline at all costs.
565,"✅ Trip Verified | Better than walking but not much faster. An hour and a half after we were supposed to depart, we are still sitting on the tarmac, listening to repetitive lies about 10 more minutes."
566,Not Verified |  Very disappointed in the customer service and lack of communication. Southwest verified and ensured that a pet could fly under their policy with the owner during his move to another state. Seems it was a very different story when they showed up in person. Owner was faced with abandoning the pup or not seeing his family.
567,"Not Verified |  I used to have no issues with this airline, until the last few flights I had with them. I upgraded my ticket to sit in row A, the very front row. During the whole flight I can over hear the flight attendants conversations, all they talked about was the passengers in a very rude way. Just gossiping about them all not knowing that the first row can hear every word they said! I looked at one of them in the eye when I heard them talking trash on the passengers, and he quickly smiled at me and changed their conversation like if nothing was said, he knew I heard what they were talking about. Very unprofessional. The next flight that day I would have to say that the flight attendants were a ton worse! I got yelled at for lowering my mask to eat a snack, in his words ""You have to raise your mask above your nose in between bites and while you chew"", I have never heard of that rule until this flight. Later that flight I fell asleep and was rudely woken up by the guy because my mask was at the tip of my nose (not under) and they threatened to ""get the captain involved"" I said go ahead. Keep in mind I'm not against masks, I'm against harassing people for your own beliefs that we can't even eat without getting yelled at. I'm 7 and a half months pregnant, and of course they never got the captain involved because that would have gone nowhere for them but make them look stupid. I could over hear the passengers talking about how rude he was because it wasn't to just me, everyone. After reading other Southwest reviews, I know this isn't happening to just me. Your employees need a customer service class because the behavior from all your flight attendants is just absurd. I will never fly with them again. Back to Delta and American Airlines"
568,"Not Verified |  We understand that airlines have to cancel flights from time to time. That's not the reason we feel SW deserves such a low rating. The reason for the rating is the way they handled the communication and willing to help us out once they canceled the first flight in our trip and their response for assistance. It is too long of a story to share in this review but the short of it is that the flight they canceled and did not tell us about until we were checking in, cost us an additional $900 and a full day of our honeymoon. We reached out to them several times and the only response we received is the COVID excuse with no willingness to assist in any manner. We do not plan on using their future travel plans. Poor customer service!"
569,"Not Verified |  I have heard about all the disrespect from customers on some Southwest flights especially since covid 19 but I must say that as someone who use to love Southwest Airlines and I still do in many ways, I am finally back in a hub city and want very much to fly Southwest. I think that some of the staff members could use a refreshers course on customer service. We are all coming through a very difficult time that has left a lasting Imprint on our mental health in one way or another. If you want respect you could give respect too. I was accused of not putting my seat up twice on my flight coming back into Las Vegas on 05/16/2021 when finally the last flight attendant had the sense to realize that the seat was up as much as it would go. I became sad as I felt that I was being accused of disobeying commands. I am one who truly believe and want total peace in the sky, it used to be why I chose flying over other forms of transportation. everyone deserves respect and a polite reminder of more than a half second may be needed in some cases where disputes are of concern. We are afraid of what happens to us on flights just as you guys are anxious about us, lets all be kind to each other and spare a little empathy as we continue to get well together. Thanks for your service."
570,"✅ Trip Verified | I have only flown twice in my whole life. My first experience was with Delta Air Lines and it was amazing. My second experience flying with Southwest Airlines was absolutely horrible. Seating is at a first come first serve basis. Therefore if you check in super early you are guaranteed better seating? Well I checked into my returning flight about 16-18 hours before my flight and was still put in the C category, meaning that your one of the last groups of people to board. Not wanting to be the last group to board me and my fiancé paid $40 per person, a total of $80 to get a boarding pass in the A group. A7 and A8. Pittsburgh was to board at gate C9. While sitting there waiting to board our plane an announcement was made that all of the sudden Pittsburgh was to board at gate C11. So everyone on that flight ran over to gate C11. When we got there to board about 140 passengers were already on the flight and the guy boarding the plane said ""oh you probably won’t get to sit together since there’s so many passengers on already"". We said ""ok well we paid $80 for us to be in group A so we could sit together."" In return he said ""I made the announcement a few times in 2 hours."" Ok well if that were in fact true then everyone else would have heard him as well. I’m completely dissatisfied and disappointed with this airline. I will never use them to fly again. Your better off going somewhere elsewhere where they have assigned seating and can help you out, not ruin your whole trip. We should get reimbursed for the extra money spent since we paid and did not get what we had paid for. After landing in Pittsburgh at our destination we approached the attendant asking what we could do to get our money back for our upgraded seats and her response was, “The tickets are non refundable sorry.” So we then asked if there’s someone we can call about the issue and she said, “You can call but you still won’t get your money back.” Seriously after paying over a thousand dollars for the flights already then another $80 on top of that for upgraded seats is just ridiculous. It’s highly disappointing and I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone."
571,"✅ Trip Verified | This is a long-overdue review. I have been flying with Southwest since I was a little kid and they had ashtrays in the seats and the planes were brown. I have been an advocate for Southwest my whole life, and in college (I majored in business) we would study how Southwest excelled at customer service and ""hiring right"" when compared to other airlines. I lamented flying with other airlines because I know the way I would be treated. And finally, I signed up for the Chase credit card to fly with them more often. No more. My past 3 flights during the tail-end of the COVID pandemic have been beyond horrible. Nonsensical mask policies when compared to other airlines, I witnessed them kick a baby (a non-walking baby) off the flight due to not being able to keep a mask over its nose. Repeatedly yelled at over the coms for ""not abiding by the mask policy."" People - most of us have had it or are vaxxed. You are sacrificing the one thing that made you better than other airlines. Something tells a small room in the corporate office in Dallas are making these poor long-term, brand-ruining decision for some short-term ""I am not liable"" gain. I have a sneaky suspicion my kid brother will be studying ""the rise and fall of the Southwest Brand"" when he gets to college. I fly next month. If it isn't even marginally better by the time we are exporting vaccines, it's time to cancel the credit card and go with another airline. And if my office of 30 Employees is any indicator (one used to even be a stewardess for Southwest) I know I am not alone."
572,"Not Verified |  Arrived at airport with boarding passes in hand, checked luggage, employee at luggage check in counter made a change to my wife’s boarding pass but didn’t give us a new one. Got to TSA check in and her boarding pass would not scan because of the change they made. She was in a wheelchair so they changed her boarding pass so there would be help at our destination. Had to go back other end of terminal to get a new boarding pass. Back across terminal, through TSA and the door to the plane was closed. Next available flight had one empty seat. Southwest’s response was sorry these things happen, you should have been here sooner. We were prepared for our flight when we got to airport, we were at TSA but could not go any farther because of a change they made. And they said it was our fault. Lost $3000.00. Got reimbursed $0.00. The only mistake I made was not buying the insurance. One would think a company like Southwest would correct their mistakes."
573,"✅ Trip Verified | Every single flight your stewards are the rudest individuals I have ever experienced. I have worked at Macy's my whole life as a manager and these guys, I would be firing them. Immediately. Not happy at all. Disrespect after Disrespect. Please make them take classes on customer service and most of all respect and kindness to others. "
574,"Not Verified |  I hadn't flown in a very long time but the flight attendant Lindsey was very calming, compassionate, attentive and extremely helpful in making sure all of my party was together and waited with me. This was flight #1746. Thank you so much for your service Lindsey."
575,"Not Verified |  SFO to LAS, quick and easy flight. Been flying with Southwest Airlines for years. No delays on the flight while waiting to board in San Francisco. The flight was smooth, overall service was great, flight attendants were very approachable. Landed in Las Vegas with no problems. I’ve been recommending Southwest Airlines to family and friends for a while, and they’re overall satisfied as well."
576,"Not Verified |  This was one of the worst trips I’ve ever taken on Southwest. The gate attendant kept calling for help for a customer service agent to help people with boarding passes, other issues and a tag for an elderly person’s wheelchair and they never came. That delayed the boarding process for 15 minutes then we all boarded ready to go and the captain comes on to say that we will be delayed 10-15 minutes waiting for ten bags to come from another plane. That being said we left 50 minutes late. On top of that they only served beverages and snacks one time when we were on the plane sitting and hour to take off and another 5 hours in flight. Plane was full and cramped. Their new planes have thinner cushions on their seats and backs and for someone with back issues it was so uncomfortable."
577,Not Verified |  I only fly Southwest and my experience this trip is one of the reasons why. Great customer service. I purchased my ticket for 49.00. I was scheduled to return to Dallas on Monday but I needed to change my flight to Tuesday. I read online that there was no fee to change a flight unless the flight was a different price. When I searched the flights for Tuesday there were no flights for 49.00. I called customer service and they changed my flight at no additional cost without a problem. There is no other airline that does that. I received a confirmation email before I even ended the call. That is excellent customer service. I love Southwest because I can fly to Phoenix every year for 100 bucks round trip with the wanna get away specials and they are the only airline that doesn’t charge for luggage. I am a loyal Southwest customer.
578,Not Verified |  Very poor customer service. I’m a cancer survivor and due to Covid I had to cancel my flight last spring. Now that I have been vaccinated I tried to rebook my flight and I was told that my credit had expired. They had my cell and my email and no one could let me know that my credit was expired? They advertise no cancellation fee but they won’t credit your ticket for a cancelled flight or let you reuse the credit a year later. Worst airline ever. My entire family will never fly them again!
579,"Not Verified |  I tried to book this flight with SWA points but I was short of points. A screen popped up offering me the option to buy an additional 8000 points. I agreed to the option, purchased the points, and clicked ""next."" When I got to the end, another screen popped up saying that I was still 500 points shorts and I needed to buy more points. Except the minimum number of points I could buy was 3000. I tried to cancel the transaction so I could redo it and buy only the points I needed. I emailed SWA and spoke with their phone rep, only to be told emphatically that ""all point sales are final."" This is a total hoodwink by SWA.  I will try to avoid flying SWA in the future. SWA's ""buy points"" option is a scam for which the company should be ashamed. "
580,"✅ Trip Verified | Horrible. Unorganized. We paid extra for specific seats and were stuck in the last row last number. Every time we’ve been in the last seats all the way in the back that are so firmly upright and bend forward. The guy next to me should have been in two seats, he was a large guy and I was on top of my bf the entire ride. Then the lady when we were boarding called certain numbers and when we got up she gave us attitude and changed it so we were last."
581,"Not Verified |  I have to share because I am so upset! Our family has flown Southwest for years and will never fly them again! We called the airlines twice to verify the mask exemption policy for my grandson who just turned 3. After lengthy (hours) of hold times, we were told by 2 separate employees that we were to bring our doctors excuse and the exemption form from their website to the airport that day. After hearing the most recent horror stories on the news regarding them we called again this Sunday night. We were disconnected after a 2 hour wait. Then we waited on hold another two hours to be given totally different information! This lady was telling us the excuse and exemption form needed emailed in at least 7 days in advance! We were already at day 6! I asked if a supervisor could call me since this is totally different information than we were given and was told that I could get back in line and wait for one. Monday morning my daughter waited on hold two hours, got a supervisor, and was disconnected just as she started to speak. She waited another 90 minutes and was given the information of where to send in the info. She sent it in and received a receipt by email stating that they would let her know in 30 days! She called to address this and was given a number to call today and she was told to press option five. When she called the number today there was no option five! She left a message somewhere, they eventually called her back to tell her that he would’ve been approved for not wearing a mask but because it wasn’t seven days ahead of time, it wouldn’t be considered! We confirmed by actually speaking to 2 separate representatives their policy and procedure prior to purchasing tickets(which was 100% inaccurate) we followed every direction they gave us. This was their mistake! ￼They couldn't of cared less what we we were told. Southwest Airlines is the most disorganized mess! ￼￼￼￼￼￼Such poor customer service doesn’t belong in business. And it’s ridiculous that anyone under 6 wear a mask anyway. In researching many other countries airlines do not require anyone under 6 to mask! You mean to tell me the whole plane can takeoff their mask to eat and drink during the flight, but a three-year-old has to be masked for 2.5 hours! We had re-purchase tickets with Delta! They were very helpful in communicating the process with our airline. They will be flying out this Saturday on Delta!"
582,"Not Verified |  I was planning a trip to see my daughter in Houston last year, I purchased my ticket 6/3/20 for a Nov flight. The flight was rebooked by Southwest customer service without my knowledge. I never received any type of notice saying that my flight had been rebooked. I called Southwest to confirm my flight date last year and at that time I was told I had been booked on a different flight. I tried to cancel and the customer service person told me that I couldn't cancel, I could only receive travel funds and I had until June 3rd 2021 to use them. I didn't argue because I thought that was policy. I then tried to use the travel funds on 5/9/21 for a fight in July and was told that I had to use the funds by June 3rd (FYI this customer service person I spoke with on 5/9/21 was terrible and did not try to assist me at all. I disconnected and called again to talk to a much more pleasant person on 5/9/21. She advised that my flight was rebooked last year by Southwest and according to the notes I was not contacted and not given the opportunity to decline the rebooking. She then expressed that I should call Corporate to see if there is anything that could be done to allow me to use the travel funds. I called Corp on 5/10/21 and low and behold I get another terrible customer service person. She listened to respond and didn't listen to hear. I was told I couldn't use my travel funds because the dates were out of range, ignoring the fact that I was not given the opportunity to refuse the rebooking last year. After being put on hold twice she finally told me that I will be given a refund that will take up to 30 days to refund. I never fly any other airline but Southwest and I do have opportunity to fly another airline with my job. I choose Southwest because I was a loyal customer. But if your customer service people will not respect the consumer why should the consumer frequent Southwest?"
583,"Not Verified |  Overall not a bad experience, comfortable seats, drink service, nice mask enforcement, great service, no major issues. Flight attendants were helpful and attentive, even taking time to reserve a seat for a friend. Slight delay on ground, nothing major. I was impressed and pleased."
584,✅ Trip Verified |  Left Kansas City and got Chicago when I went to board plane from Chicago to Miami boarding wouldn’t work. Sent to customer service I had A boarding pass. Went to customer service and I was shown as on flight from Kansas City so reservation cancelled. Had to make new reservation and given c boarding pass on full flight. Back of plane middle seat. When arrived in Miami couldn’t check in for flight tomorrow go to counter and they had to manually do it and give me boarding pass B 57 back of the plane I ask to talk. To manager or someone to make complaint they told me call 800 number! Really! Called 800 number and was on hold twice for 30 minutes tried again and last time was on hold for over 2.5 hours customer service is terrible really gone down hill. I am a frequent traveler for business at least two trips a month. Just be aware no customer care currently on Southwest!
585,"✅ Trip Verified | Haven’t flown Southwest in a while and unfortunately, it’s going to be a long time until I do so again. Several issues: Paid for early bird boarding, but I wasn’t checked in as indicated and didn’t received priority boarding. Boarding system is just outdated. With all the technology available? Lining up according to a number with open seating is just a joke. Once we boarded plane, we were delayed for almost an hour because the ground crew forgot to load the bags. No kidding. Everyone was on board and 15 minutes after departure time, the pilot came on and said the forgot and we’re rounding up a ground crew to load the bags. Sorry Southwest, but you’ve lost your edge."
586,"Not Verified |  Our non-stop flight from Phoenix to Tampa was great with fun staff as usual. The return non-stop flight was cancelled due to weather. My husband and I were booked on different returning flights with multiple stops. After paying for a hotel at the airport and directly speaking to a Southwest employee, we were able to get a flight out the next morning together with only one stop. The flight was a nightmare. Staff was rude and mean about demanding their covid restrictions (which was not the case on our original flight to Tampa). Our masks (which we wore on the original flight) were NOT accepted by this staff and we were forced to wear their blue, chemical laden masks on top of our own masks. We were then hassled throughout the flight to be sure our noses were covered, even though I observed several other passengers with their masks below their noses. At the end of the flight the most militant of the staff announced that we should stay in our seats until our row's turn in order to ""maintain social distancing""!!! Hilarious since we had all just spent 2 1/2 hours eating our snacks with no masks and being stuffed into seats at full occupancy. I had to laugh out loud. We have always flown Southwest and in the past found their staff to be courteous and fun. Sadly, another death of covid is the staffing at Southwest. We will never, ever fly Southwest again."
587,✅ Trip Verified | I flew Southwest 2 or 3 times a month during Covid last year and to date this year. I was understanding when they made changes and they were accommodating as well to get me on a plane. This time they changed my direct flight out of Memphis where I fly in early and fly back out the same day to adding lay overs that will not make it work for my meetings I have set up. I can fly direct out of Nashville and they have made the changes in past multiple times last year and even last week when I flew with no additional fees. Now since the flights are filling back up they want to charge $350 to make the changes. You would think they would take care of their loyal A List Preferred customers. I guess I'll be looking at other carriers in the future to do my business with.
588,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a flyer on Southwest. Perhaps not as much as most people, but a number of flights per year. I have a Southwest Rapid Rewards number. I was flying to Portland from Ontario, CA, with a stop in Sacramento. I was going to see my Mother in Salem, her health had deteriorated rapidly after falling and breaking her hip. She was sent home under hospice care with as little as a week to live. I was determined to see her. We landed in Sacramento which showed a 4 hour layover. I didn't want to delay and needed to get to Salem. I checked Alaska and they had a flight that would arrive 2 hours earlier. I booked the flight and flew Portland. After arriving in Portland drove to Salem to see my Mother. That afternoon I received an email from Southwest informing me that the rest of my itinerary had been canceled and all payments forfeited. I called and the support person said because I didn't cancel the flight, and didn't inform them, that my return trip was canceled and money forfeited. I guess I forgot to read the fine print. Because of this policy, even though I felt it more important to get to my Mother's side, I now didn't have a return flight. I used to fly Southwest. But with that uncaring, insensitive response to stand by their rules. I am no longer a Southwest flyer. I will tell everyone I can my story, and encourage them NOT to fly Southwest. "
589,"✅ Trip Verified |  We understand that we are living in unusual times but we don’t need reminded with an overbearing personality about the mask mandate 12 times during the flight briefing. This was the foundation for our flight with a non- personable stewardess that continually bumped their way up and down the aisles with no recourse to the paying customers. We can understand 1 of the crew having a rough day, but not the entire crew. If they are not happy and would like to act like robots; then maybe they need a update on personal service. Thank you for the many years of wonderful flights, but unfortunately, this was not one of them."
590,"Not Verified |  The ticket agent thought he needed to be funny by rallying a war cry from the audience as we started boarding. Really!? Just take the tickets and shut up. Then he was yelling into the microphone but his voice was high pitched and we could neither hear nor understand him. If you want to be a comedian, go downtown. I expect professionalism at the airport. The same onboard. Just make the announcements and lets move on. Sarcastic comments that aren't funny tend to make me wonder if the mechanics maintain the plane with a sense of humor as well. If you announce that you will serving snacks, serve the snacks! We had a smooth flight so no reason to not serve what you said you were serving. Maybe this is good during a daytime flight but we were flying from 9-11pm.. Just do your dang job."
591,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight attendant made the decision to not let my 5 year old daughter use the bathroom all the while she was trying to hook up a car seat for the passengers in front of us which took almost 20 minutes. Another passenger was kind enough to give us a pull-up that my daughter ended using because she couldn’t hold the pee anymore. She then had the nerve to tell me if “I let you go, everyone will want to go as well.” How appalling, she lacked compassion in the decision she made and was trying to justify it. "
592,"✅ Trip Verified | I've previously written about four negative experiences that I had in a row flying on SWA. I still had a small travel voucher that I didn't want to go to waste, so I decided to use it. My experience was average, I suppose. While I've also written generally glowing reviews about SLC airport, the SWA check-in staff at SWA were blasé. Not rude, not mean, but also not remotely interested-acting or helpful. Just robotic. I even get more helpful service on United (relatively speaking, and that says something). Same for the SWA gate staff. As for flight staff, the flight attendants were a mix of very cheery and upbeat (almost scarily so), or yeah, blasé and even kind of bossy to and barking orders at passengers. Not very helpful. At least the FA I had to interact with for the most part was the cheery and upbeat one. Once at Houston Hobby, it took almost 30 minutes to retrieve checked baggage from the carousel, while this may be more of a Hobby airport personnel problem, this is a problem that Southwest needs to address with airport management, as the airport is an airline hub. On the bright side, the plane was almost spanking new and very clean. The snack and Coke served were delicious. The plane was only about half occupied, though I don't know whether that has to do with bookings and demand, or with the fact that we're still in a pandemic. Social distancing was possible and enforced, as a result. Overall summary: at least this flight experience on SWA was average rather than hostile, so I guess that's an improvement for this airline. I still wouldn't recommend, as it will take many more average or above-average flights with them to convince me that they're not actually the worst airline in the USA (and I'm far more willing to fly on Delta or Alaska normally anyway for domestic flights)."
593,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Way too many delays, absolutely no social distancing precautions. One plane comes in with minimal turnover time to disinfect before it leaves out. I understand why COVID numbers are rising!"
594,"Not Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience, I've flown 5 times since covid and you are the absolute worst. Flight was delayed 5 hours, and not once did we see anyone cleaning. There was no order to calling seats, section A was called but some B and C were allowed through at any time for no special reason other than getting in line before their turn and I use the word 'line' loosely, more like a cluster stampede. Masks were not enforced, people coughing unmasked. Tray on the back of the seat had sticky juicy all over it and the seat next to me, trash in pouch, obviously no cleaning. We were served open plastic cups that were carried on a tray down the isle that anyone not wearing their mask/ wearing it below their nose were breathing all over. Unboarding customers from the back were rude, unbuckled before we even stopped and then jumping to the front of the plane, instead of waiting your turn like it's always been. Stewards should be enforcing order from chaos. Plane was jam packed, no space in-between seats, strangers sitting right next to you taking off their masks to eat and drink. Keep in mind this also is a plane leaving Miami, Florida, 3rd highest covid state in the whole US."
595,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight provided no social distancing. I checked in exactly 24 hours before. My son and I got C1 and C2. Southwest allowed other C people to board before us. We were the last people on the plane. We looked for seats together and had to move back toward the front to find middle seats in different rows. Never again!
596,"✅ Trip Verified |  A big thank you to Camille (at Raleigh durham) for helping us find our wallet that we left on the plane, she went above and beyond to make sure we found it. We really appreciate it!"
597,✅ Trip Verified | As a service member in the Army I’ve never come last or after a group when it came to boarding. At least 60 people boarded before me and it was open seating. I had to rush off the plane to catch my ride to the base before it took. Every other airline prioritizes service members but not Southwest. I just figured all airlines recognized military personnel a lot better especially if we are in uniform. Nothing against the civilians but I feel like all we’ve done for this country especially on an open seating flight we should be able to be the first ones of and the first ones on.
598,"✅ Trip Verified |  For an airline that claims to put passenger service and safety first, I experienced the exact opposite. During my most recent travel (first time since the pandemic), I flew Delta Airlines from DSM to TPA with a few days in ATL in between. On the way home, I flew Southwest from TPA to DSM through DIA. My two experiences could not have been more polarizing. To begin, my Southwest flight was changed three times before departure in both departure day and time as well as the connecting city. Each flight I was on, they were fully booked and I was sandwiched next to strangers on each leg of my journey. I was treated rudely by gate agents and flight attendants as many of the passengers were confused and rather frustrated at both the boarding process as well as the capacity issues. For an airline that claims to put their passengers first, I will speak for everyone on each of our flights by saying we all felt like an afterthought. I will not be flying Southwest Airlines again."
599,"Not Verified |  After reading recent negative reviews about Southwest, it seems that our experience is one of many. You wouldn't believe the way this flight crew was behaving. Totally unprofessional. They don't talk to you, they talk at you. If you have a question, get ready for a snarky, clipped answer. They don't want to help you. They just seek out reasons to scold you. I realize that good help is hard to find, but Southwest should look harder. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they're overworked. Maybe they had a bad flight experience earlier that day. But taking out your frustration on the passengers is no way to behave. It's really not difficult to be nice."
600,"✅ Trip Verified | The flight with them went very well going to Florida, but the staff we had going back to Las Vegas were horrible. When we boarded our flight, I asked 2 flight attendants if I had time to go and change my 11 month old daughters diaper before take off, one flight attendant said that I would have time to as we had about 5 minutes before take off and the other was not so happy about the idea and had an attitude. My son is autistic and wearing a mask for him is uncomfortable and he cries hysterically if it’s on, the flight attendant that was not happy about me going to change my daughters diaper proceeded to tell me that my son needed to wear a mask, I explained to her his situation and she gave me a dirty look and went to the front of the plane to tell her co-worker. I walked to the front of the plane as well to go and change my daughters diaper but that flight attendant and the other worker she was talking to were in the way, she turned around and saw me and said “she’s right there” the guy looked at me and told me I had to go back to my seat and change my daughters diaper when we were in the air. I went back to my seat and my son was crying hysterically and screaming at the top of his lungs because of the mask I had put on him. We take off and we’re in the air and I see about 3-4 people get up to use the bathroom. As soon as I get up with my daughter thinking it was a good time to change her, the flight attendant talks on the intercom and tells everyone to stay sitting until the seat belt lights are off, I was so angry at this point because they never said anything up until I stood up to finally go and change her diaper. These workers were rude and were not pleasant to my kids and I. They were very disrespectful in the looks they were giving my kids and I and we’re very passive aggressive towards my family and I. Worst experience I have ever had. Luckily, the passengers around us had no complaints about my family and I and weren’t giving us dirty looks. They were understanding and trying to make us not feel so bad."
601,"Not Verified |  The worst experience. Please tell me how it makes any sense to have flights completely full during the covid pandemic. Packing in people, separate from their families, with no regard to Covid rules. Never again Southwest."
602,"Not Verified |  Horrible, packed in like sardines! No regard to social distancing. Very disappointing. Separated from family and no regard to COVID. I will think twice before flying Southwest again."
603,"✅ Trip Verified |  This airline fails to meet domestic standards when it comes to safely handling passengers' suitcases during transportation. They will offer an unlimited number of suitcases for you to check in, charge you exorbitant amounts of money for it, but then damage your suitcases and belongings and loose part of it. They would apologize at your arrival and offer you very bad quality ""emergency bags"" to contain the rest of your belongings so you can take it home, and some 2 cents voucher and keep your damaged property promising you that the airline will cover its cost if you go on some specific online platform that is difficult tp access with codes and other information and send them your ticket information, pictures and tags - but once you follow all of their nonsense various requests and even provide them with photos and receipts, they will call you a liar, deny responsibility and basically just tell you: ""go ahead, sue me"". Complete unprofessionalism and abuse of power and totally unethical ways of treating passengers. They damaged and lost part of my belongings and it has been a month that they have been playing games and sending nonsense conflicting letters where they are basically insulting the passenger and demanding completely unrelated things. They are offering free 2 first suitcases for a reason!!"
604,"✅ Trip Verified | Was planning on flying from Denver to Austin Texas. Flight to Austin was canceled so I ended up going to Salt Lake City instead. Southwest Airlines sent my luggage to Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Dallas. Am now stuck in Salt Lake City without luggage. Have spoken with 8 different customer services reps in Vegas Phoenix and Salt Lake. This is the biggest waste of my time, do yourself a favor and fly with someone who gives a damn and takes pride in their work."
605,✅ Trip Verified | I was turned away at the gate due to my oversized bag. A bag I’ve flown with on many other airlines. They refused to consider how much they were inconveniencing me. I had to rebook through another airline the next day at top dollar and I was given a travel voucher instead of a refund. A travel voucher that will do me no good because I don’t fly without that bag.
606,"Not Verified |  Worst trip ever! I paid extra for business, it's first come first serve. They won't give me credit for false advertisement. I paid $80 extra for accommodations that didn't exist. They gave me a voucher for a free alcoholic beverage that they don't serve (no alcoholic on board) and they did not enforce the mask policy. The woman to my left and right were unmasked the entire flight. Have pictures to prove it. It's the greyhound of airlines. Horrible!"
607,"Not Verified |  This review is to sing the praises of your customer service representative, Shundalynn. I called Wednesday morning around 11:00 to schedule a trip and inquire about the flight I had to cancel 3/31/20 due to Covid complications. From the beginning of our call, Shundalynn was very pleasant. I was concerned about using the money from my cancelled flight to book the new one. Shundalynn went through the process with me. I was delighted because things are sometimes confusing for me at my age, 77! she was so kind and helpful! Southwest is lucky to have Shundalynn as a representative! I have flown Southwest many times. I have never been disappointed with a flight or the great customer service! Keep up the good work! "
608,Not Verified |  Our flight was to board at 7:10 a.m. and the counter to check in bags did not open until 6:00 a.m. There was a line of people to check in. We had to rush through security and barely had time to go to the restroom and grab a water for the plane. Horrible way to start our day. We will not fly with Southwest again. The service has really gone downhill!
609,"Not Verified |  Southwest Airlines took my money for a flight to Costa Rica, then Southwest stopped flying there and they won't refund my money. They told me I could reschedule but had to fly within a year. They still haven't started flying there and they told me I will just lose my 1,050.00. They blamed it on Costa Rica, but that is a lie since other US Airlines are flying there. Southwest Airlines just flat out stole over a thousand dollars from me. Whatever you do, do not book with Southwest Airlines. They are literally high-class thieves."
610,✅ Trip Verified | Wifi didn’t work at all. Movies stopped and started and were impossible to use. Flight was full. No warning. No option to change flights. No safety at all. No spacing at all. People with masks down. Awful. Very unsafe.
611,✅ Trip Verified |  My flight was supposed to be from 8:45 to 1:15 and they rescheduled it 3 times. The last time they canceled my flight at 9:30pm at night the day before travel. We literally moved our entire schedule around to fly at 8:45 and now at the last minute we have to scram to get to the airport 3 hours early! Not to mention they scheduled a 5 hour layover that we would have never booked! In addition due to their idiotic no assigned seating policy I checked in exactly 24 hours before my checkin time and was lucky enough to get in boarding group A. However on the rescheduled ticket they put my husband and I in group C! What’s the point of me waking up to check in on time!!  I will never fly this airline again!
612,"Not Verified |  Had to land at 2 airports along the way. All was fine in regards to arrival and departure times. Served ""snacks"" on 2 of the flights. ""Snacks"" consisted of dry, hard, chocolate chip brittle and a bag of dry, hard pretzels and another mystery ingredient. All was well until the plane from Las Vegas to Atlanta filled up. Then it became 3 people per row. At that point there was no room to move much and in no time at all my back was killing me from being so uncomfortable. The seats would not recline and felt extremely cramped. The cabin was much too narrow and should never have had 3 per row seating. This was my first and last time flying with Southwest."
613,"✅ Trip Verified |  I guess my flight was ok. I got on six different flights 5 of them the staff was awesome and the other one the staff was annoying and unnecessarily controlling. I was really disappointed that I was informed late that my returning flight was canceled after I already checked out of my hotel and was on my way to return my car. They did not offer any help to people that they stranded, such as a room voucher or a ride to the airport, totally unfair! My luggage that I purchased 3 days before my flight, (I have the receipt), looked as if it had been dragged on it's side instead of rolled (which was very easy to do). After getting home I felt uneasy about my trip. If I feel like going cheap and taking chances with my situation, I'll use them again."
614,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight 6216 Southwest Airlines January 5, 2021 scheduled to depart Denver airport at 3:40 PM. The flight did take off and land safely at the destination, BWI airport. My checked bag arrived as it should. There is nothing else I have to write that is a positive comment about the way this flight was handled. First of all many of the passengers were not wearing their masks as required in the waiting area before boarding the flight. Some of the same passengers, at least 23 by my count, boarded the plane without their masks covering their mouths and noses. They walked in this manner by the Southwest flight attendants and were not stopped or directed to comply with the rules. A lady and an Asian man seated themselves in seats 4b and 4c. They began taking about liberty and their freedoms and would not wear their masks. Seats 4d, 4e and 4f. had passengers that would not wear their masks properly and they began discussing liberty and freedom loudly. The spoke to a passenger nearby that indicated they should comply with the rules since we have a global pandemic. Those passengers commented that their is no pandemic and the new media has promoted a hoax. All of the sickness is a hoax including the media, the drug companies and the liberal media. It is difficult for a crew to control morons. The crew did have several opportunities to not allow these individuals on the plane to begin with. If they will not comply in the boarding area then they must not be allowed to board. Other passengers and I purchased our tickets to fly based upon the contract and trust that Southwest would not allow passengers on the plane if they would not comply. For the first 30 minutes the Captain and the First Officer did not turn on condition air to save Southwest money. Once security removed the lady that was ranting, denigrating the flight attendants and other passengers, the Captain and First Officer did get the air conditioning going. The flight remained at gate C27 for another hour as the crew sorted the mess. Several passengers never wore their masks properly. I do not want to get COVID and you do not either. Southwest executives must believe times are normal and have forgotten the raging pandemic. The boarding process jammed people next to each other in the name of loading quickly. The lineup of passengers in the aisle was jammed with many passengers in contact with each other. The paln had few empty seats. Wake up airline executives, you have lost me as a customer until the pandemic is over. I do not recommend flying any commercial fight until the airline executives from ever airline realize they must take a loss for the time and hold planes to a 50% capacity until the pandemic is over. Passenger safety should be the most important goal of any airline. Getting sick with the possibility of death from the illness is a definite threat. If you can charter a plane or have your own plane these issues will not affect you. Commoners like me will drive of find another way to get safely to any destination I must go to for work. Otherwise I am following the Governor's orders and minimizing any travel and recommend that to everyone. There is no reason not to wear a mask. I tried Southwest and you failed me. I would like to think I can fly safely but after this flight  I will not be flying on any airline for a long time. I felt as if I was in jail. Adapt Southwest, you must keep us safe!"
615,"Not Verified |  On January 3rd 2021, I arrived to ORF with 2 checked bags, a book bag personal item, and early bird seating. We were off to Nashville around 1500 with dense fog noted. Soon (10 minutes?) after takeoff, it seemed like we were not ascending as usual. The cabin became unusually hot and there was an awful plastic/metal smell with some vibrations that I thought was just turbulence. The captain came overhead to inform us we had struck a flock of birds and we were returning to Norfolk to service the engine. The next 20 minutes were terrifying as we glided back down to safety and I applaud the flight crew for returning us safely...however the next few events following this incident is where I have some issues with southwest. I have always enjoyed flying with southwest airlines and I am an easy customer to please. I frequently travel and understand that there are some circumstances that flight crews and airport personnel can not control. However, I found the way that Southwest dealt with the situation was despicable and disrespectful. A simple phone-call to follow-up after a terrifying incident would have sufficed. However, I want to acknowledge how great the employees were at the gate dealing with the rescheduling issue and the flight crew (unless they failed to report it...). We all exited the plane and were asked to wait in the terminal. Everyone was confused and no one was sharing information and there was only 1 person to help direct all 180 of us on what to do next...(she was awesome, thus the 5 star ground rating). The flight was canceled and I was pleased that SW attempted to reschedule me to get to my final destination to MKE (Nashville was my connection). I ended up asking to change the one they rescheduled (Orf to orlando to MKE) and flew directly to Chicago and drove up to Mke from there. So...never heard word from southwest about the incident, do I get money back? I know that direct to Chicago was cheaper. And I didn't get my early bird status. I checked the FAA bird strike database, not even reported...I hope they actually inspected/serviced that airbus. The next day I was happy because I called and asked where my checked bags were and the very helpful lady informed me that she would make sure they made it to MKE from Nashville (I'm glad those people who waited for that rescheduled flight got to go!) and SW called me when my bags were ready to be picked up.But all in all, I am super salty that our plane hit birds and had to turn around and was not once addressed by the airline. No ""We are sorry you experienced that"", no flight coupon for my early bird. I mean if I wanted to be treated that way they should at least make us sign a safety waiver?"
616,"Not Verified |  
Tickets were cheap and quality followed. My initial (12:40pm) flight time was delayed until (6:50pm), gate was changed 3 or 4 times and no real explanation given. My Connection would have been missed so they directed me, which I originally appreciated until I realized it would be another 5 hours of waiting. As I sit I am now waiting another 3 hours due to an other delay on their end. I would originally have been home at 10:20pm but now it appears I wont be home until 12:45am. Very unpleasant experience and I will not be flying Southwest again."
617,"Not Verified |  Long wait times to board, was supposed to leave at 2.20, didn't get out until 2.40 from the gate, then sat on the runway for 30m at midway with no information from the pilot or crew. Very lame customer experience and no communication. SW was at one time great, they are at their worst now! Very regretful for choosing this airline from Midway, a complete disaster here in Chi. Been on the plane for 1 hr and no one is telling us what is going on. "
618,"✅ Trip Verified |  My son and I had the greatest pleasure of flying with Southwest Airlines on flight 6588 departing Philadelphia to go back to Atlanta. My travel date was 10/09/20. The flight attendants were great however my greatest shout out must go to the pilots. I traveled with my son has autism and this was his second time flying since he was a baby. He did great going to Philadelphia. Both flights (going/returning) were great smooth rides. As we were leaving the plane my son stood looking into the cockpit and the pilots were so nice to him allowing him to look and even answer questions. He even took a picture! They did not know he was autistic all they saw was a curious little boy that wanted to see the section of the plane that has all the controls. Thank you to the pilots and the gentleman that was with them. You truly made our flight the above and beyond experience. You showed such great hospitality and kindness to him giving hope that we still have wonderful people that live in America even if their skin color is different from yours! Kudos to you Southwest for providing exceptional service. The Southwest staff was a pleasure from welcoming the passengers onboard to the delightful and amusing at they announced the safety protocols. One passenger ask the staff member while boarding was his seat first class and the gentleman replied, “all our seats are first class” and the passenger smiled. Thank you Southwest for your Services."
619,✅ Trip Verified |  On my first and connection flight they were asking people to wear masks over their nose. I fall asleep on my connecting flight from Baltimore to Maryland. Wake up from a sleep to a flight attendant asking me for my ID. I had no idea what was going on. 2 days later they send me an email banning me from their flights and canceling my return flight. I had not one warning the whole time. I had to book a whole other flight with delta just to make it back home for work. I will never ever fly with Southwest again. They have lost a long time customer.
620,"Not Verified |  My husband and I just few SouthWest airlines over Thanksgiving 2020. We were both so  impressed with the staff in all areas. They were fun, professional, and made traveling during a challenging season a great experience. They told jokes on all of our flights (4) and also kindly reinforced the use of masks and social distancing. I cannot say enough positive things about our flights. Thank you Southwest for a great travel experience in a season where it is very hard to travel!"
621,"✅ Trip Verified |  100% full when the COVID 19 virus is worse than ever. My wife and I are in our late 60's and we did not know the center seats would not be empty like it was flying to Phoenix, going home tonight is extremely uncomfortable and we are very worried that we will get sick. I can't believe SW would endanger passengers this way, bound to lead to massive lawsuits. If we get sick we will add to the lawsuits for sure. Long flight home."
622,"✅ Trip Verified | I must share my recent experience. I love flying Southwest, the employees are fun and accommodating, but this year which has been a tough year for the whole world and to top it off as an active military family we were recently put on orders to move out of state, making this year even more emotional and scary having to travel. Well while flying out of Ontario CA. On 11/28/2020 my husband, son and I were waiting to board and as usual Southwest has always treated military greatly so we wait for A listers and group A to board, usually small children and active duty is called next to board but we understand that doesn’t happen every time everywhere, well my husband approached the operations employee and kindly in a soft low tone asked do you allow military to board early here? Well a simple sorry sir no would of sufficed, but he just gave the most annoyed attitude tone and said “No we don’t, and you can go read online if you want” he didn’t even allow my husband to finish his sentence and he was extremely rude. Wait! You think that’s all oh no, we waited for our group and number to walk up and he looked at my husband and said “wait let me check that it really is your turn”, he didn’t want to let us on the plane until he made sure he verified all three of our tickets as if we were too incompetent to read the big letter and number on the boarding pass. I could feel and sense his anger and annoyed mood towards us with just his stare. I’m not one to give reviews much but this really bothered my heart and mind. A smile and a positive attitude can make a huge difference in a person but not bigger than a negative attitude and a frown. Flight 1258 out of Ontario, I will forever remember your rudeness and lack of care toward the military member “my husband” that has volunteered to serve so that your family doesn’t have to be drafted, so that all that freedom you have is possible and so that your personal family can feel safe. We do not expect special privileges but we do expect common respect and good customer service, as anyone should for choosing Southwest Airlines. "
623,"✅ Trip Verified | At the point of boarding the plane, I was verbally accosted by the gate agent who rudely embarrassed me by loudly stating I had too many carry on items to board the plane and that I needed to ""go over there and check something."" I politely tried to tell the woman that I had a bag with food for the flight and a fleece jacket in it. Didn't matter. I was accused of having a fanny pack when I was wearing a waist belt in lieu of carrying a purse. I had a mini backpack with chargers that per Southwest, are not supposed to be checked in baggage and a small suitcase. I was not given an opportunity to combine anything. I do not consider a waist belt, which I was wearing and is similar to a money belt or passport belt, to be a carry on item. It takes up no more space on my body than a belt on my pants. I never remove the waist belt and it does not impede sitting in a single seat or fastening my seatbelt. I do not consider food that I was going to eat in flight, especially as I was taking an antibiotic at that time for a GI condition, to be a carry on item. There were many, many other passengers who were carrying food on the plane in addition to other carry on items. I have never heard of a coat/jacket being considered as a carry on item. When I left Phoenix it was almost 90 degrees. When I arrived in Detroit 4 hours later, the temperature was about 45. To say a jacket/coat was necessary is an understatement. The gate agent was incredibly and unnecessarily rude. I was embarrassed unnecessarily in front of other passengers waiting to board. I have GI issues and cannot eat anything that might have been served in flight. Taking my own food on a 4 hour flight did not seem unreasonable. The mini backpack I had is about the size of an ordinary shoe box. Had I been given the chance, I would have combined items (except the waist belt) but I was denied that opportunity. I submitted a complaint to Southwest post-flight and received an email that in essence, blamed me for having so many carry on items, quoted a number of Southwest policies on baggage as if I do not know how to read and more importantly, failed to provide what I consider to be a sincere apology or any language about the gate agent receiving any kind of coaching, reprimand or training to correct her inappropriate behavior. In other words, it was all my fault. I am not ok with that. I have flown Southwest many times in the past and never had this kind of experience. I hope to never fly Southwest again. Public humiliation is uncalled for, period. Not being given a chance to ""fix"" my ""mistake"" and being ordered around rudely and loudly like a bad child is uncalled for. And to make matters worse, after we boarded the plane, we then sat in line with 24 planes ahead of us and took off 30 minutes late. Wow."
624,"Not Verified |  Second time flying since the pandemic. The first time was with Delta which was so impressive and their concern for customer safety was evident. Not so much with Southwest. Proper mask wearing was not enforced, no disinfecting wipes were provided, all attendants did not wear gloves and distancing was not observed at all when leaving the plane."
625,"Not Verified |  I have always flown SW and had pretty good luck with them until recently. I had a credit that was about to expire, I went to book a flight online and my credit would not go through and I was told to call. After calling they had to ""look into something"", I didn't get a call back for over 2 weeks, and I was calling them everyday! By then my credit was expired and they said they only thing they could do was give me the credit back minus $100! I talked to about 10 different people, all with awful customer service! This is not ok, especially during such hard times. I will never be flying with this awful company again."
626,"✅ Trip Verified |  Had to cancel my flight in October 30, 2019 and was given credit in my ""travel funds"". This credit was good for 12 months and had to be used for flights made by October 30, 2020. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and because I and my spouse belong to the higher risk group (older than 65) and are having some other health related issues at this time, we cannot take a chance to fly until it's save for us. Unfortunately, Southwest has not modified its 12-month expiration policy due to COVID-19 as I would reasonably expect. I called their Rapid Rewards and Customer Relationship asking to give us extension, but ""Sorry, it's our policy"" was the only answer I got, so we have lost our credit."
627,"Not Verified |  My Dad bought my ticket for October 20th, 2020. My Mom had to go into the hospital on October 13th. I called to move up my departure date. A reservations representative, was able to get my ticket for Thursday, October 15th. He then called me back saying that he could send me even a day earlier, Wednesday, October 14th. He made sure emails were received and confirmed. He was very professional, showed human empathy and interest in my Moms emergency situation. My elderly parents are so grateful and appreciative of his kindness. "
628,"Not Verified |  I wanted to acknowledge an experience from a excellent customer service representative at Southwest Airlines. On October 24, I spoke with 3 customer service representatives at approximately 8.30pm until 9.10pm and at that time spoke to three representatives who were asked to assist me in rebooking using our Southwest credit from the beginning of the pandemic. All three representatives told me that I had different amounts of credit remaining. I had $963.96. The first rep assisted us in booking our flight but them told us we would have to pay $130.00 more. We eventually got hung up on before we could resolve the issue. The next rep told us we had $466. Again, we somehow were disconnected from that call as well. We spoke to the last rep of the evening and he again said that we had $466.00 I asked if there was a part of our trip that was already booked that we did not received email confirmation. He said no. After going round and round with him, we again got disconnected. Now, Oct 24,2020. I spoke with another rep. She researched our situation which no other agent could do and realized that was in fact correct and had 963.96 credit. She was patient, apologized for the other agents and my experience and took care of the situation with 10 minutes. We also found out that the first agent sent my confirmation to the wrong email even though it has been on our records. She had set it up as two transactions and told me that since it was already booked, there would be two confirmation emails coming. I wanted to let Southwest Airlines know that this rep talked me down. She listened to me ramble about the three other reps."
629,Not Verified |  I have been sitting next to my gate for the past hour and have had the experience of witnessing a flight attendant with a black “Supreme” mask on be extremely helpful to absolutely everyone that has come up to her. It has been so fun to see everyone that is helped walk away her with a smile (under their mask of course) on their face due to her friendliness and willingness to support the Southwest customers here. She has excellent customer service and my experience of her work ethic alone is enough to make me want to fly Southwest again!
630,"Not Verified |  I booked my flight in October of 2020 to go and visit my 74 year old mother in Las Vegas. At the time, they stated nobody would be sitting in the middle seats, and now they send me an email stating that they are going to sell the middle seats. The alternative they are giving is to get your money back, really? I guess I don't want to see my mom over the holidays. I have never done anything but boasted on how good an airline Southwest is, but this is ridiculous! They do not care about the safety of their passengers or their employees! Horrible service!"
631,✅ Trip Verified | Southwest says they are are customer focused. But I told them I needed to change my ticket to an earlier flight because of an emergency and they politely told me I need to purchase a new tickets that cost twice as much. They don’t have the review feature turned on so I can’t leave a review. We are in a pandemic. These airlines want to be bailed out by the federal government (our money) but they don’t have a heart for the people.
632,"Not Verified |  We made reservation to fly with Southwest to Tennessee last year for a wedding. We were not able to go. I called to get a refund but they said they could not give us a refund but instead gave us credit that would expire within a year. I called them to extended the credit. We are first responders and could not take vacation during this pandemic. As a first responder it is not that easy to take a vacation then quarantine for 14 days. This was explained to the person I spoke with. The credit was extended but they deducted 200 dollars just because ""its policy "" Their was no accommodation given to us. Shame on Southwest for benefitting off of their customers during these rough times."
633,"Not Verified |  Last week, my husband and I flew Southwest to Orlando. Flight was good until the end. The flight attendant had the supervisors call the cops on us. There was 4 cops & 2 supervisors waiting for us in the gate when you walk off the plane. Obviously face masks are required during the flight, unless you were eating or drinking. During the flight, my husband fell asleep and I put my earbuds in and started drawing. He slept with a neck pillow and his face mask would catch on the pillow and slightly fall lower than his nose. The flight attendant woke him up a couple times and asked him to pull it back up. He apologized and went back to sleep. As far me, I went into my purse to grab 2 mints and a protein bar. I pulled my face mask down to put the mint in my mouth. The flight attendant snapped and told me to put my mask back on, I said I was eating. She said, “it’s only a mint and if this is going to be an issue, I’ll call the supervisor!” And stormed off. We land and get off the plane only to be greeted by the cops. The cops questioned us on what happened on the flight. The cop told us that face to face conflict/confrontation was reported from the flight attendant and that’s why they were called. The supervisor looked up our return flight and revoked them. All over sleeping and eating a mint. The flight attendant might have had a bad day but it’s not enough justification to go out of your way to wreck our trip. Her behavior is unacceptable. I understand you want to keep everyone safe. But you’re taking it too far. Not once did we raise our voice, or stand up and cause issues. Revoking our tickets over something this small, is unbelievable. If it’s that big of deal to eat on the flight, then stop serving water and snacks. Southwest, I want to truly thank you from the bottom of my heart for blowing things out of context and wrecking our trip. We cannot thank you enough for your unbelievable customer service."
634,"✅ Trip Verified | While in Jacksonville we were treated terribly by the employee boarding us at the gate. He allowed my oldest son to get split from us, then when I told my son to save us seats this employee snapped back at us that ""this ain't a school bus"". I responded that we were traveling as a family and again he snapped back with ""um yea but you ain't gotta sit with them,"" to which I replied yes these are my children and I would absolutely prefer too. Absolutely unprofessional and ridiculously rude employee! Not at all comforting to know that they will split mothers from children that they are traveling with and give you attitude before getting on what may be a nervous flight already!"
635,"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest is an amazing company that represents compassion for their customers. They issued me a complete refund when I was too sick to make my flight. And while most companies would choose greed over what the right thing to do, Southwest chose to be different. I have never had a bad experience with Southwest and now I will never fly anyone else because of how they chose to represent their company. Thank you Southwest!"
636,✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Denver with Southwest Airlines. Worst airline ever! Flight attendants are not friendly or helpful. Stayed online for 1 hr 27 minutes to speak to someone who was no help at all. Stay away from this airline. It sucks!
637,"✅ Trip Verified | I understand that face coverings are required while in flight unless you're continuing to eat and drink however I think that Southwest needs to reconsider the type of face coverings, they have now banned all masks that have ventilation and they also banned bandanas as a face covering as well. They said that you are able to wear a face shield but you still have to wear the mask under that as well. I think that is wrong and they need to reconsider all the options as for face coverings because if all of the stores have no issue with the face shields neither should they. Overall great staff and great flight."
638,"Not Verified |  Rather than give me alternatives to solve my ticketing questions, they just hung up on me. American Airlines took care of me in about 6 minutes. Customer service is a wonderful thing. Southwest was built on customer service, it's a shame they've forgotten that."
639,Not Verified |  Austin TX to Raleigh NC. This has absolutely been above and beyond the worst flight I have ever experienced. The staff are beyond rude. The explanations about delays are nothing but confusing. I will never ever (even if it would be free) use Southwest again. Absolutely garbage to the core. Do not trust. Cannot respect. Will go out of my way and pay more for another service.
640,"✅ Trip Verified | First and last time flying Southwest. Likely the worst airline I have flown to date. From check in to leaving the terminal it was a terrible experience. The kiosks were not working and the customer service woman was incredibly rude and not willing to help. This first come first serve seating is absurd. The flight attendants looked like they couldn’t be bothered and were busy chatting. I got chastised for taking my 4 year old to the bathroom when the seatbelt sign was on - for those who have children - a child they age can’t hold it when they have to go. I know all airlines have to impose a mask rule during COVID - but only allowing certain kinds of masks is outrageous. What is even more infuriating is the way they treat children and the parents when they can’t/won’t wear a mask. One woman was not let on the flight because her 2 year old wouldn’t wear a mask. How can any 2 year old be expected to wear a mask? In my opinion, this is overboard. I fly several times a month and this is the only airline that treats people this poorly. I never thought I would say it, but I would fly Spirit any day over Southwest."
641,Not Verified |  Southwest has now stated that they do not have to notify you of a change in flight status. Booked a flight July 1 for Sept 19. SW changed the flight Aug 3 without notifying anyone. Found out 16 hours before leaving that flight was changed and now I will miss the wedding due to the change. They could put me on Delta and I would make it in time but they are not willing to do so. Why should I have to pay 3 times as much because they did not notify anyone anyone (this was verified by their agent). They refer me to contract of carriage page 43 para 3 stating that they have the right to change flights and will notify as soon as possible. Well they had from Aug 3 to Sept 18 to notify me yet the only way I found out was Sept 18 when I went to pre board. Their response was oh too bad that we did not notify anyone of the change. They should have put me on the Delta flight at their expense. They had 46 days in which they could have notified people of the change. Will never fly Southwest again.
642,"Not Verified | I got a notification e-mail the day before my return flight that my flight was cancelled. I called the airline, and it was hard to understand the agen during the full phone call. When I repeatedly asked why my flight was cancelled, the only reason he could drum up was that my flight was ""not ticketed"". What in the hell is that supposed to mean? I payed for a higher class ticket so that wouldn't happen. Then he tells me that I'm getting a refund for my return flight. Let's say it's $450. But then he sets me up with a new flight, on the same planned day, with a different airline, that costs let's say $870. How does this make sense? This not only is the last time I fly with Southwest, but it's the last time I fly PERIOD. I'll take a train or rent a car."
643,"✅ Trip Verified |  The absolute worst experience! I have flown with SW about 12 times since the COVID disrupted our world. This day was humiliating to say the least! Once onboard I had my face mask on as requested. I had lowered the mask below my nose while my mouth was still covered to take a couple of deep breaths before take off. The female flight attendant was walking past and immediately reprimanded me. I quietly tried to explain what I was doing. Her response was that of a nazi ruler saying this wasn’t acceptable. During the 30’ flight it was time to take my prescription so I ate a snack so I wouldn’t take the medicine on an empty stomach and then took a drink of water. The entire time the attendant was just staring me down. Once we arrived HOU and I stepped off the plane the neo-nazi was standing there and pointed me out to her manager. They then said obviously my health needs wouldn’t be acceptable to fly with them and denied me to make my connecting flight, leaving me stranded 1300 miles from home!"
644,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was traveling from Las Vegas to Louisville on flight 5456 on Aug 19, 2020. While in the waiting room waiting to hear my number, I noticed the two Pilots of this flight come out and talk with the wheelchair customers, after which they then pushed their wheelchair onto the plane. I was never so touched by what these Two Pilots did. I have never seen this before and will never forget it. Thanks to Southwest for another reason I only fly this airline. "
645,"✅ Trip Verified |  What happens when your luggage doesn't make your connecting flight on southwest airlines. I was aware my luggage may come in on a later flight and that as confirmed by Louis from baggage claim. I spoke in person to Louis and he called to confirm my bag was in flight to Tampa and would arrive on the 10pm flight from Memphis and that I would get a call when it arrived. According to him my bag would be held in the baggage claim office for me to pick up. I received a call around 10pm that they didn't have my bag yet and would call me when it came in. The following mid afternoon I received a call that my bag was thought to have been stolen off the baggage belt. Knowing my luggage would be there at 10pm, is it to much to ask that it be secured in the baggage claim area? The associates failed to do so. I received an email that Southwest took no responsibility for my loss and I might file a claim with a secondary insurance if I have one. Thanks for the advice! The value of my Pro travel bag and contents is more than $3500. Of which it looks like I am plain out of luck! Through no fault of my own my free checked bag is ending up costing me over three grand. Southwest sent me an email stating they take no responsibility for my loss. Well failure to secure and protect my belongings makes them totally responsible. If my bag was in the office it couldn’t have been stolen. Sorry for trusting a company that obviously doesn’t really care about its customers."
646,"✅ Trip Verified | Apparently Southwest’s new slogan is, “If you don’t comply, you do not fly.” Forget “Welcome Aboard” or the “Somebody Up There Who Loves You.” Southwest staff have always been considerate, pleasant and hospitable. No more. Now they are mask enforcers - thoughtfulness is over. Yes, we need to wear masks. We get it, but there is a way to manage it. Yelling at your paying passengers and repeating “If you don’t comply, you do not fly” fifty times is not it! There is a kinder way to enforce the mask rule. Customers are not the enemy. We are the people showing up helping Southwest stay in business. Flying is difficult enough now. Southwest used to be the friendly airlines with people who liked their jobs and their passengers. No more."
647,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is a review of Southwest customer service. I had to have a representative book my husband's return flight after a three week battle over Rapid Rewards points I'd purchased. That battle was more than enough; multiple calls, points never showing up, had to purchase the points again. I wasn't able to book the flight myself because of the points situation, so I called in. I told the representative I needed to book my husband on my flight. The itineraries were related and my flight was in the system. She said she put him on my flight. She did not. When I opened the email about an hour later, I realized it was the wrong flight. I tried to call; they close at 3 pm AZ time. I called the next morning thinking it was very annoying to have to call again but that they would change it. To my surprise, I was told they were not going to change it and I could pay the difference to switch him to my flight. A $478 difference on a $91 flight. They are insistent that they will do nothing even though it is abundantly clear that the representative blatantly booked the wrong flight. They do admit she booked the wrong flight and never told me which flight she booked, but it was my fault for ""not checking."" Stupid on my part, but I didn't realize I needed to check the work of a representative in the highest customer service department of the airline. It is shameful and disgusting and I'm going to have to cancel my trip. It has been horrible service on top of horrible service that has gone on for almost a month. Not sure I'll ever fly Southwest again, which is a shame because it used to be my favorite airline."
648,"✅ Trip Verified |  Everyone has to wear a mask. So, a woman sat in my row with an empty seat in between. She took her mask off the whole flight. Not one stewardess said one word. They looked straight at her. I feel they jeopardized everyone on the flight, especially me. I was going to see my elderly mother. I would hate to pass anything to her while I am visiting. I am very disappointed in Southwest."
649,"Not Verified | Today, on 08/22/20 Flight 1541 at 07:40am, a Southwest pilot (never revealed his name) went above and beyond for a 12-year-old who was extremely terrified flying the first time by herself (yes, she thought she was brave enough to do it). The crew tried to calm her and she continuously screamed that she wanted to go home. One flight attendant held her hand, everyone tried to calm her, and the pilot apparently let her into the cockpit (prior to taxi away) to hopefully ease her fears. She eventually calmed down. The same pilot then proceeded to escort her off the plane, bought her breakfast from Chick-fil-A, and took her to her next gate! I can't even begin to express the gratitude. I would write a letter of appreciation to the CEO if I knew who he was, I spoke with him while I was on facetime with her. Although I'm sure that the crew was probably at the brink of putting her off the plane, they comforted her and completed their flight. I love Southwest, always have!"
650,"Not Verified | We went to the airport to pick up a minor from a flight from Atlanta, and we were talking about the fact that we wanted to make a sign to welcome my grandson home, and the agent informed me that she had some construction paper and a marker and let us pick and make our signs, since she wasn't busy and there were no lines. We thought it was a really nice gesture on her behalf, that she was able and willing to help us out. "
651,"Not Verified | Received a $100 Luv voucher that resulted from a six plus hour flight delay. Have tried multiple times to use this voucher only to have events cancelled because of the current pandemic. In anything resembling “normal” times I would have redeemed this voucher long ago. However, there is nothing normal about covid-19 and no end in sight at this point. Southwest absolutely refuses to extend the expiration date on this voucher. We lost an entire day of vacation because of the original lengthy flight delay. $100 was the least Southwest could do in response. $100 would have brought them tremendous good will and a positive review. Instead, a dismissive and obnoxious customer service rep has created a disgruntled customer and negative reviews on multiple social media platforms. Guess they believe saving 100 bucks is worth getting called out for bad service."
652,"Not Verified | Worst experience ever. My mom's flight was cancelled in May because of COVID19. We were told that we could not get a refund-even though we were all in limbo. We accepted a rescheduled flight 4 different times because the travel restrictions for this inadequate airline was not lifted. My mom had to book through another airline to get home before her visa expired!. I called in June and spoke with a rep who saw our plight and offered a refund within 14 days. Its been 2 months and i call back only to find out that the request has been cancelled because my mom's flight has been cancelled and rebooked too many times! She didnt do that, you guys did after denying her a refund. Worst ever!"
653,"Not Verified | Worst experience of my life. On my wedding night just a few hours before my wife and I were to leave on our honeymoon, Southwest changed our flight throwing off our car rental, parking spot reservation, and hotel stay. It was changed to 48 hours later ... for our honeymoon. When I called to ask for help the girl was extremely rude, and told me “that’s not my issue.” Worst business I’ve ever seen."
654,"Not Verified | So disappointed. We always have been loyal to Southwest. Even when people would make fun of us for flying them. We loved flying with them until they completely dismantled my stroller and did not take one ounce of responsibility. Did not offer $1 to fix it. Their policy is obviously in place because they cannot do the right thing. I get it. things happen. But offer to fix it when you broke it. Or hire employees who can handle things with care. Every airline has done something to our things. I get it happens. But never in my life have I received something back that is now unable to use that has not been offered the moment they see it to replace it. Instead we were greeted with a ""Maybe you shouldn't travel with such an expensive stroller"" Will not be flying anymore. Anyone with a stroller, fly someone else. It's worth it."
655,Not Verified | We took a flight out of Tampa 7/19 to Milwaukee and it was a great flight. Everything was very clean and social distancing was great. We as customers with this virus going on appreciated the care and concern your organization has taking. We will fly Southwest again. Thanks for doing a great job.
656,Not Verified | Like many others I had to make changes in my plans due to Covid. Southwest only offered a voucher for future flights. No where on there website do they post refund policies involving the Early bird check in option. The problem is the voucher they offer for my early bird check in expires prior to the flight voucher. Somehow this makes sense to them. I hate this airline and will avoid using it in the future. They must need the money more then me. 
657,"Not Verified | I was on flight 1911 today on a direct flight from Milwaukee back to Phoenix. I wanted to comment that the entire crew did an outstanding job in handling customers. Efficient, polite and very friendly. I sometimes fly first class with another airline and they treated me today very well just like a first class customer. It was a great experience. I will be flying with Southwest more in the future. It is very difficult with masks and everything else but it was pleasant to say the least."
658,"✅ Trip Verified |  Purchased return tickets for my mother, son & 3 grandkids to return home from a staycation with us in Atlanta (my mother has COPD and want allowed to take oxygen on either flight but I was assured that a wheelchair with an attendant would be there for her). The evening before the return flight I got a call telling me that they had overbooked the return flight (not my fault or problem) so we changed to a flight 1 hour earlier. Got the family to the airport 1 hour and 20 minutes early ... no wheelchair was there for my mother, they told my son to go find one in the terminal, which took about 20 minutes. No one from Southwest offered to pushed my mother and my son got into the line and passed 2 agents that didn’t say a word that wheelchairs were not allowed in that line! Long story short they missed their flight and now they want to split them up to get them home ... can’t and will not happen. I called and no one offered me any help or resolutions. My family is still sitting in the airport. Never again Southwest."
659,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest is always a good trip, and this one was no exception. The open seating concept is good in that it gets you to check in on time, and allows you to sit in the front for free. The cabin is also comfortable, but there are no USB ports or power outlets. Snacks and drinks were free, and there was a good stream to your device entertainment system. Flight attendants were also great. MSP Terminal 2 is nice but lacking in concessions, and BWI is always a good airport to use. So, good experience."
660,Not Verified | Took a flight from Atlanta Ga. to San Antonio Tx to visit a friend. I did this same flight last year with another carrier had nothing but trouble missed first flight because of run around by the agents at check in at the time I was 16 years my father went to help me. We were there 3 hours ahead of time we did the same this morning and he ask for a gate pass since this was my first flight alone. They are no words to describe the difference the Southwest made in us getting through the line in what I see as record time. I do mean all the Southwest people went above and beyond not only for me but everyone else. Keep up the good work and welcome to Atlanta Ga.
661,"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent flights despite COVID-19. On the outbound flight, flight attendants didn't enforce the mask policy, which is disappointing, however they were still friendly and provided an excellent service. Return flight had Flight attendants enforcing mask wearing. Water and small snack bags were given on the short flight. WiFi/IFE app worked great"
662,"✅ Trip Verified |  I scheduled a spring break trip for my teenage son and I prior to COVID. Because of such, I was forced to cancel the trip. Southwest credited the funds to my Southwest account but only under the original ticket names (my son's name and my name). I am no longer able to travel with my son and have twice requested the funds under his name be transferred to my husband. On both occasions I received only a form letter which outlined their policy and never addressed my actual question. I don't understand this being that they have nothing to lose by transferring the funds to another family members name. I suppose they are hoping, as is the case here, that the funds can't be used. Shame on you Southwest."
663,"Not Verified |  I have a Southwest travel fund for $167 that expires Sept. 17, 2020. I had planned to use it this Spring, until national restrictions due to Covid-19 prevented my travel. In May, a Southwest travel rep reassured me the travel fund expiration date was extended to Dec. 17, 2020. I was SO relieved because $167 is a good amount of money I didn't want to lose, and I couldn't travel again any earlier than October 2020. But when I tried to book my flight (in June), I got an error message that said my travel fund expiration date was Sept. 17, 2020. I immediately called Southwest customer service to explain that I was told the wrong expiration date by one of their reps and due to Covid-19 health concerns and regional restrictions, I can't use my travel credit until October 2020. FUN FACT: Did you know... Southwest is extending the expiration date for travel funds that expire between March 1 and Sept. 7, 2020, to now expire Sept. 7, 2022? That now gives travelers 2 YEARS to use their travel credit. I have to assume they've done this to protect the health of those Southwest fliers who don't feel safe flying any time soon and in the midst of Covid-19. What a nice, and very practical, gesture! Let me remind you my travel fund expiration date is Sept. 17, 2020. And because it falls 10 days later, my own health and safety is NOT prioritized by Southwest travel policy-makers. Instead, I'm forced to use my $167 travel fund by Sept 17, 2020 and risk not only my own health, but that of my friends, family and fellow fliers -- or it disappears forever. I spoke with several reps (including a customer relations manager) and none of them gave a damn that I couldn't use my travel fund, when I was initially told by one of their reps that it expired on Dec. 17, 2020. That doesn't sound like transparency to me!"
664,✅ Trip Verified |  New Orleans to Detroit via Chicago. Let's start with my flight sent an update saying the flight was delayed 45 minutes which was fine with me. Then a page goes over saying those flying to Detroit please come to the counter. I get to the desk and I was told it was only 1 seat left but not on the delayed plane I would have to wait 4 hours or until the next day. Needless to say I was VERY UPSET. Once I finally make it to Detroit I find out 2 items were missing out of my bag I immediately called the Metro Airport baggage office. I filed a claim the same night hours later I get an email from Southwest saying they don't cover theft and I just have to suffer the loss. I will never fly Southwest they are on the list of the worst. Amazes me how these corporations do the very people who pay them. One lost customer won't harm them but I definitely can make sure my company doesn't use them again and I surely won't use them. Ever!
665,Not Verified |  They cancelled the flight 1/2 hour before takeoff without saying why. Then the put us on a flight 5 1/2 hours later without offering a meal voucher. All of the airport restaurants are closed. Everyone should be wearing masks but aren’t. I’ve been forced to sit for 5 hour in a cesspool of corona virus because the airline decided profits above people. If it was mechanical they’d have said so. 
666,"Not Verified |  My wife and I usually always fly Southwest because we love the staff and the overall experience. Today’s flight was no different from all of our other great travels with Southwest Airlines. However, it’s a real bummer when you get an employee who is rude and doesn’t even make eye contact with you. I myself am in Customer Service and would never treat a customer in the way I was treated. It honestly felt as if I was an inconvenience to this employee. I simply asked about where by babies stroller would be... She first told me, “Sir you can’t go in there.” Fair enough so I asked her if she could help retrieve the stroller for me. When she brought it back out she didn’t even acknowledge me and was incredibly rude. I Her tone was bitter and she cared more about chatting with her peers about her 3 days off she has coming up. I didn’t get her name cause I had no desire of any additional interaction with her. I flew from Burbank to Denver into gate C23. We arrived around 2pm. I have no intention of getting anyone in trouble but that lady might need a little refresher on customer service. She must really need those 3 days off. Thank for your consideration"
667,"✅ Trip Verified |  We fly Southwest for their easy, fast ticketing and reasonable pricing. Yesterday was the first time since 1999 that an attendant failed to use common sense, a trait Southwest is known for. Staff in Denver announced loud and clear that we are allowed 2 bags only to board. That's always been the rule, however, countless times common sense is applied first, written rules second. I have boarded many, many times with my small over the shoulder purse, small backpack, and my carry-on suitcase. ( this was my return trip from Denver! i had traveled 4 days ago in identical fashion) I watched closely as others boarded ... 3 large bags, a woman with 4 items, one fellow had 2 large items, neither fit under the seat, and so on and so on. He never stopped anyone, so i knew his announcement was just routine in the case he truly had to limit someone. I was the last to board with B 21. (flight not even close to full) He stopped me and asked me to please put my purse into my backpack. My purse and backback are small, i am a small person, nothing was even hanging outside of my person. Both items were so empty they easily fit together. Both items tucked under the seat did not even fill 50 percent of the space. Why did he even bother? Why did he have to make one person's experience less than pleasant. In B 21 I was the last person. Flight was not even half full. There's no good reason for him to do what he did. The lady with 4 bags was so loaded down in size and bulk that she held up the entire plane for deplaning. She couldnt carry her items front ways or sideways! But me, small items that were tucked onto my person, me he HAD to target!? He does not represent Southwest well at all and should receive the same training countless others before him have been given. Southwest is by far the best airline my family ever travels and the poor actions of this fellow are an embarrassment to the company."
668,✅ Trip Verified |  I'm writing this with a heavy heart and a serious headache. I booked a flight on Mar 27 for May 11 on April 5th southwest changed the flight. I got an email and was told to rebook online at no additional cost. By that time Jamaica had closed the boarder and the situation was so uncertain so I asked to be refunded instead of changing or being credited. They told me no my only options were the two previously stated. I told them that it was unfair for me to be stuck on their timeline since it was ever changing. Anyway with no other option I revoked for May 22. That was canceled and I got an email notification. I changed again to June 6. Now june 6 was being held based on the multiple conversations I had with CSR. I applied for my leave days and everything based on the information provided by their app stating that my flight was still on. A few days before my flight I called southwest because of an Instagram post I saw about international flights entering orf having issues only to find out that my flight was canceled days before without notification. I lost wage revenue since my leave days were already booked with my company and now I have to request additional days to actually going to VA. Then they called and offered me a voucher like that was somehow going to help my situation. I cant pay bills or eat using a southwest travel voucher. I'm extremely disappointed and upset.
669,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest in the middle of a global pandemic is stealing customer’s money, the airline is are begging for tax payer bail outs but refusing to work with customers when they have elderly or family member with serious medical conditions that make it unsafe for them to fly with the covid-19 fully knowing that people with compromised immune systems are at a higher risk. I’m sorry to rant but this is frustrating we should not allow these airline companies steal from Tax Payers and then turn around and beg for a bail out."
670,"✅ Trip Verified |  Incredibly disappointed in a company I’ve trusted for so many years. A company known for outstanding customer service. Southwest Airlines not only cancelled my late July flight with no notice, when I log into my account to book another flight is when I see I have no upcoming trips so I call customer service only to be told sorry it’s out of our control we can issue you a refund within 30 days. It certainly didn’t take them 30 days to collect my money when I trusted them to book a flight with them. Unfortunately they have permanently lost a customer, not acceptable Southwest Airlines."
671,"Not Verified |  Tampa to Havana. I been traveling continuously with Southwest airline since 12/2016 once a month at least. The most remarkable thing i like about this airline its that every single time i traveled have been a ""on time"" flight. Other than a rude employee at TSA checking process never had a complaint. Last February 27 i did have a really stressful situation on board when my Son who have ASD (autism spectrum disorder) did not board the plane, even when he pass true TSA checking and was lined up at the boarding gate. All the sudden he disappear,at that time i was on board already. That situation make me feel a lot of emotions, from panic, shame, frustration etc. After 45 minutes of desperation the manager on charge have talk to me in a kindly manner and she offer to travel the next morning with out any charge. Even when there where some unconsidered and rude passengers on board they clarify that my son its a high sensitive passenger and they cant just depart with out take any action, at least look for him in the gates area. in my experience,they behave in a really human manner, more than just worried about business. For a LOT of reasons but this one specifically i have to THANKS all and every single one Southwest employees."
672,"Not Verified |  The problem is really with the website and customer service. I was charged more than expected when I booked online, I had called to get it fixed and it was only partially addressed as I discovered when my credit card statement arrived. I called again and after spending an hour on the phone, I was told by the agent that he could not help me with anything involving charges to my credit card. I was stunned that we had spent so much time on the phone if he couldn't help with my issue. I asked why he didn't tell me this within the first few minutes of our call and he claimed that he wasn't allowed to tell me this. I asked him how he was allowed to tell me when he did if he wasn't allowed to tell me earlier and he said he didn't know but that was how he was told to do his job. The other scary part of this is even though I was using travel funds to pay for a ticket and the funds completely covered the cost of this ticket and yet somehow the system was able to charge my credit card without me entering the security code and approving the charge. Bad service and bad website function. They also charged me for early bird checking when they knew I wouldn't need it - I am disabled so I get to pre-board."
673,Not Verified |  My review has nothing to do with my last flight from Kansas to Seattle it has everything to do with my up coming trip from Kansas to New Orleans. My husband and I were set to go on a cruise leaving June 7th the cruise line canceled our trip due to COVID 19. I called to cancel our flight and they want charge me a fee to refund my points back to my account. I trip to talk to the SW representative and she hung up on me. I am a long time SW card holder and with the way I was treated I will be paying my card off and closing my account. Very rood and unacceptable behavior from SW customer service.
674,"Not Verified | St Louis to Phoenix. Southwest really shows “luv” for its customers. In my opinion, they are truly the best of the best, sure there may be no meals, but for the lowest price possible you still get free drinks, a pleasant experience and free entertainment. Southwest also has no change fees, no baggage fees and amazing customer support. I’m from St. Louis and we don’t have a very big airport, but Southwest still is able to fly me anywhere in the country from my home airport, directly to where I’m going. On top of everything Southwest has the best flight attendants, they are so nice, caring and attentive. I can see why people only fly Southwest. Some people love all the features of other airlines but I think you should get out of your comfort zone and see the Southwest difference."
675,"Not Verified |  Much to my chagrin, Southwest has pulled the rug from under my feet. My well planned vacation to the wonderful world of Disney is falling apart. All because of Southwest Airlines' villainous change to my pre booked and confirmed airline flight that occurs two months from now. This shows a complete disregard for their loyal customers. Do we mean nothing to them? They changed a 10 o'clock flight to 7:30 am without my consent. Obviously for nothing but their own convenience. How am I supposed to drop my pooches off at their home away from home? This will not be possible now. Do they even care? From their email notification that I received after they changed the time, it does not appear so. Whatever executive made this horrendous decision should be shamed. I wish I could talk to their mother/parental figure and give them a piece of my mind. I have been on Southwest previously in my life, and their service was perfectly fine, but this experience has changed my opinion of them. Such a shame."
676,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst experience ever! I was exposed to Covid and on doctors orders to stay in until further notice. Not only that but the destination of my trip had implemented a 14 day quarantine upon arrival. What am I supposed to do for 14 days in Texas? Missed flight for return and unprecedented expenses. How inconvenient not to consider refunds for lost causes. The customer service was down right rude and no one I spoke with showed an ounce of concern! I’m going to tell my story to anyone who will listen. This is ludicrous. A pandemic breaks out and a company that is receiving bailout from the government chooses to be greedy and not refund when families need their funds more now than ever. I’m off work, my husband off work and your organization won’t even display the decency to have a manager talk with an escalated call. Sorry Southwest! Y’all are officially trash!"
677,"Not Verified | Tampa to Birmingham. My wife and daughter were scheduled to attend a gymnastic competition in Birmingham, Ala. The event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak. I thought that a refund would be given, especially since it was cancelled because of a pandemic, but they are telling no refund, we will give a credit that has an expiration date. This is unfair and shows a serious lack of concern for customers and I want to make sure that the word gets that, Southwest doesn`t really care about you and your situation, only their bottom line."
678,"✅ Trip Verified |  Pittsburgh to Orlando. This review is not about my last flight, it is about the flight I had to cancel because of COVID 19 and my stepson having down syndrome. I have spoken with a few different representatives and only one has given me the feeling that she cares about me and my family but she doesn’t have the power to help! It seems all they care about is their money. With COVID 19 being such a problem to people with a breathing issue. It is most likely that my stepson will never be able to fly. These tickets could be refunded or transferred To another name and Southwest will not even let me speak to a Sr Manager. They have just closed the account without speaking with me. This is a worldwide problem, people had to shut their lives down and taking care of a child with special needs has shut our family down for who knows how long. Southwest Has shown me what is important to them and it’s surely not family and taking care of family! I highly recommend looking at all of your flight options before taking your flight with such a company that doesn’t care about their customers."
679,"✅ Trip Verified |  Columbus to Montego Bay. Southwest Airlines is a great airline! In spite of the COVID19, they were still full of compassion and credited all of my monies and extended that credit through next year in June! Before COVID19 if Southwest didn't fly there then I didn't use any other airlines! "
680,"Not Verified | Never been impressed with Southwest. I was moving from Houston to Dallas and they canceled my flight and texted me to rebook. I rebook and arrive at the airport and during COVID 19 I am the only person at check-in. The guy who ""helped"" me was on a personal call the entire time and when I would ask him a question, he looked upset he had to stop talking to his friend! On top of that my plane was delayed over an hour when only 10 people were on the plane. I carried on my cat and after being in her pet carrier for too long, she limped for 2 days. They also charged me $95 to take her."
681,Not Verified | Chicago to Fort Myers. We had flown to Ft. Myers on March 8th 2020 before the lockdown was issued in states. As we approached our return flight home they kept cancelling our flight. They cancelled our flight three times before I said “I had enough” we needed to get home my 1 yr old daughter and I (pregnant) had doctor appointments. I booked a different airline and called Southwest to see if they could refund my money which I had to put more money in a return flight for 2 tickets one way then I did on my whole flights through Southwest. Now I’m out almost $300 dollars plus what I spent on 2 one way tickets through a different airline. I enjoy Southwest but in a pandemic where we were thousands of miles from home couldn’t help in any way. I’m disappointed how they are and was handling the situation of this pandemic.
682,Not Verified |  Very disappointed with this airline. With everything going on today I would expect to see Southwest to have a little compassion and understanding with people needing to cancel their flights. My wife is 30 weeks pregnant and had a baby shower planned in April to fly to. Obviously that got cancelled. Southwest was at all no help and would not refund us. Thanks.
683,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Denver. Not getting a flight refund because we purchased ""Wanna get away non refundable tickets"" the trip is for May 5, 2020. for my elderly parents to come see their grandson graduate college, tickets were purchased in January 2020. When I tried to cancel them the response I received is ""unfortunately you purchased non refundable tickets"" they tell me if we cancel the reservation the funds will be saved for one year, minus $100.00 they can not give back, but not transferable. My elderly parents purchase their flight tickets even though they are on a fixed income, they are 90 years old. (I paid them back). this airline is a disgraceful, selfish, with no compassion. They care more about their rules and regulations rather than the people who are the ones that pay their salaries, the government for sure will bailed them out so they won't go under. I will never use this airline again"
684,"Not Verified | Chicago to Orlando. Southwest Airlines we were supposed to go to Florida March 17-March 24, obviously with a two-year-old with asthma who sees a pulmonologist for it every 3 months, a 6-month-old-baby and someone who is 69 and people with underlying conditions, we, unfortunately, had to make the choice to stay home during all of this. They will not refund our flights because we booked as a “group” we still paid $260 a flight and the best they will offer is new flights to go by May 30 - in the middle of a pandemic. They care more about money than the safety of humans. Seriously disgraceful - at least 5 of us have called them and got the same response that “you can email them but they don’t know if they will refund you” (my sister just got the email response that they will not). Our kids are already having a hard time with us having to cancel, disgraceful. I will never book Southwest again and before you do remember this, please."
685,"Not Verified |  Ontario to Sacramento. Purchased tickets on 2/1/2020 for May 15-16 2020 needed to be cancelled due to news that my graduation ceremony would no longer be taking part from COVID-19 concerns. I called customer service who referred me to executive office. They informed me that because I purchased ""non- refundable"" tickets, I could not receive a full refund back on my card. They only offered travel funds for future use until June 30, 2021. This is unacceptable as I did not have any idea that this outbreak would occur and it is not the customers fault.  I have no history of complaining before and am shocked that Southwest could not make any exceptions during this difficult time. Southwest Airlines should be ashamed and embarrassed for the lack of sympathy and corporate greed they have portrayed."
686,"✅ Trip Verified |  After flying from Indianapolis to Atlanta we had a 4 hour layover until our flight to Oakland. My girlfriend has a service animal and we had to the bathroom. We were in Terminal C and there were no pet relief areas open in the entire terminal. We had to walk 20 minutes to terminal B to find an open pet relief area. When we came back they had closed the doors, 15 minutes before the flight. We explained to the lady at the gate that there were no pet relief areas open yet she would not let us on the plane. We then watched the plane for 15 minutes sitting and then it backed out and left. There was plenty of time to correct the situation. The representative laughed and said ""Oh I figured you were walking your dog because I saw a service animal on your reservation."" I fly twice a week and I used to prefer Southwest but no longer."
687,Not Verified | Nashville to Dallas. I had flights scheduled for Dallas and Napa. When I cancelled the flight because of the coronavirus I was told that the early bird fees of $50 per flight would not be transferred to the rescheduling of my flights. Feels like an old fashion holdup. Will not fly Southwest intentionally ever again if I do not at least get my early bird fees transferred to future flights. Bad publicity and customer relations for an airline that in the past had put customer first. They missed a tremendous opportunity to do the right thing.
688,"✅ Trip Verified | Although many are upset because of these trying times, I have to say while we flew Southwest Airlines from MDW to Punta Cana, flight 2692 and had a great flight. We had our grandchild with us which was his first flight and the crew could not have done enough. While in the Dominican we started hearing so many rumors that the borders were being shut down and we were basically being abandoned. Well Southwest answered their phones confirmed our flight back to the USA and yes we called numerous times as United abandoned everyone at our resort and many people were left scrambling for any airline to please take them back. our flight was the second to last flight back to the USA, and we had a first row seat and I cannot tell you how many people arriving on the plane Flight 517 kept on thanking Southwest for taking them home. Our family witnessed this personally and Southwest had flown many planes empty to the Dominican to bring our people home. The best part was the crew of this flight showed all of us so much attention, and treated everyone great. One passenger had her birthday party sung to her by the whole flight and the crew gave her a bit of a funny gift and one of the crew also sang, to the passengers. By far the best flight I have ever been on. I thank the pilots for their hard work and the crew who put so many people at ease for the great time and flight. I have and will anytime always fly with Southwest due to their great service. If I could I would give them more than 5 stars."
689,"Not Verified |  Chicago Midway to Denver. Adding my disappointment in what has been known as the airlines that have the best customer service and ""caring"" for their customers. I would expect them to take the lead on understanding and how they can help customers in these scary and challenging times. I also had an event canceled due to Coronavirus and it will not be rescheduled. So I will not be refunded. Or I can use this money for a year for something else, I guess I just pick a place to go to use the money, then also will have hotel and food fees, etc? we are not a family that can afford to just go somewhere to use this. Maybe something will come up that we have to go to in a year, who knows. But this has changed totally how I feel about Southwest Airlines and I will not choose them in the future.  American airlines refunded my friend for a cancellation due to Coronavirus. Wrong move Southwest, wrong move."
690,Not Verified |  Atlanta to Orlando. Never use this company! They are not issuing refunds during this unexpected epidemic. Families are struggling out here and may not want to travel within a year. They are not considering how they will need to have satisfied customers when this blows over. I would never fly or recommend them to anyone if this is the way you treat your customers.
691,"Not Verified |  Pittsburgh to Tampa Bay. My family had planned a trip to Florida to see our favorite team play in spring training then to the season opener in Tampa. Due to the pandemic and everything we had planned being post postponed or closed we are not able to go. Southwest are not going to refund my money, I have been lied to on different subjects by at least 3 different customer service reps. The last rep, who is supposed to be a senior customer service rep, pulled the act of god scenario on me. I can still use my credit till September, if this pandemic is over, but of course no one knows. So I am starting to accept the fact that I am going to lose almost $1,000. I’m just happy that Southwest is going to be ok. "
692,Not Verified |  Grand Rapids to Tampa. I am supposed to fly March 28th I am elderly and want to cancel. I want a refund they won’t do it because it is not there policy. Other airlines have the same policy but have changed it because of what is going on! I will personally never fly Southwest again.
693,"Not Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to San Antonio. As we all know things have become a lot more difficult these past few weeks. We are living in a global crisis. But. Southwest Airlines could care less so long as they get paid. Trying to cancel a flight that was booked before everything shut down. Before the threat of disease. And I’m told I can’t get my money back? This isn’t a regular circumstance. We are dealing with a global pandemic. But again. Nobody matters more than the almighty dollar. Nothing matters more than keeping those pockets lined does it? And people wonder why nobody has any faith in American consumerism. This is why. Because the only thing that matters is money. I will never do business with your institution again. . At the end of the day, you guys can keep your measly $500. Add that to the money you’ll get when you receive your bailout money from the government. You know, the money you “need” because we’re facing a global crisis. Imagine that. Quick to receive something because of extenuating circumstances but just as quick to hold fast to their “policy” when they have to do their part. Ah yes. Corporate America has never been brighter. Two words. Never. Again."
694,✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Chicago. Unfortunately due to the corona virus my family and I are not able to attend my brother's boot camp graduation. Southwest is not honoring the military families for not being able to make it. There shouldn't be a problem refunding the military families. I thought Southwest was promilitary but clearly they are not. This would have been my first time flying Southwest and honestly I won't ever use them again. I feel like I have been robbed. Where is the human kindness?
695,"Not Verified |  Fort lauderdale to Nashville. I have anxiety when flying. A wonderful woman helped us get our flight bumped up and gave me preboarding so I could bring my husband on with me and get seats together. We had just been stuck on an extended stay on a cruise ship thanks to the covid19 pandemic so I was less than thrilled to jump on a plane. Once on the plane I got some looks going on with the others that were preboarding, but I ignored it. Once we took off, I started to cry a bit because It’s just a knee-jerk reaction and I’m not good at flying. The flight attendants thought it was hilarious. Not only did they laugh then but later before landing they were talking about me as well. Needless to say, I found that rude and less than helpful. At least I’m an adult. I can’t imagine how a child would feel in that situation."
696,"✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to Milwaukee. I appreciate Southwest and their customer service. 2 bags free is the ultimate feature, carry on and personal item, please don't change that, it sets you apart. The upbeat personalities are top rated! Was so easy to change flights online with no fees and easily refunded the difference."
697,Not Verified |  Chicago to Dallas. Very disappointed in Southwest Airlines customer service with this virus! Other airlines are giving full refunds for nonrefundable tickets because they understand and support the severity of not spreading this virus as much as possible. It is unbelievable how stubborn and uncooperative southwest had been in this country’s time of need. You should be ashamed! We will never give southwest our business again.
698,"✅ Trip Verified |  Long Island to Charleston. Because of Corvid-19, my wife and I had to rethink our trip to Myrtle Beach, especially since President Trump called it a National Emergency. I'm almost 70 and my wife is early 60's both of us are in the age group most at risk. Im told that: 1) the total cost of the flight was $421, plus an additional; $100 paid for early boarding. 2) that a credit of $221 was applied to my account 3) But I paid $521 total?. Well, the $100 you paid for the Early Boarding is not refundable! And the total amount is split between you and your wife.  I paid for the entire ticket, sorry its not done that way! SO, Southwest, isn't a good American corporate citizen capitalizing on a time of National crisis at the expense of their very customers! In the end these guys are keeping my $521 total to smooth out their downturn in travelers while the Bill is being passed to the Senate to help them out with Tax dollars which Im sure they'll also take advantage of! I can't see these Credits for the tickets and after a year I lose them! Any other time I can understand the cancelation policies, but during a National Emergency? "
699,"Not Verified |  Milwaukee to Seattle. We had to cancel and rebook our up coming flight due to the corona virus. We were able to rebook the flight for a future date but they refuse to transfer the early bird check in to the new flight. We paid for a service they never provided and now they will not honor the $200.00 we paid for this service. To be clear we didn't even want a refund just transfer the service to the new flight. This is sad as Southwest used to be my favorite airline. I would strongly recommend not spending the money on early bird check in, it is a scam."
700,"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible Customer Service. My husband and I went to Jamaica out of Tampa. Upon our return flight our flight was delayed for over 8 hours. We were given vouchers for food at the airport, flight credit and a hotel stay. We were told they will provide transportation to the hotel since we were getting back late. Long story short there were over 100 people waiting for transportation and they only sent 1 van for a total of 12 passengers. Southwest left us stranded at the hotel, we filed a complaint, was told wrong department and never got a follow up. This company just takes your money, gives false information and points the finger at everyone else and don't care about their customers. I would not recommend them to anyone."
701,"Not Verified |  Tulsa to Las Vegas. Due the current Coronavirus pandemic and state of emergency, Southwest is not refunding money or extending their cancellation policy. My Upcoming business conference has been canceled due to the Coronavirus pandemic and due to circumstances beyond my control, and I need to cancel my flight."
702,"Not Verified |  On 12th March I called Southwest to change our flight from March to July, due to Walt Disney world Closing. The customer service agent was rude and would not make any exception to help us,  in a form of credit with them for the new July date, due to them having a deadline for May. We lost $250.00 T"
703,✅ Trip Verified |  Austin to Oakland via Los Angeles. 1.5 hour wait between flights turned into 4.5 hours and my boarding pass changed from A13 to B54! Supervisor had nothing to offer. No honor with this airline. Horrible service. Feeling like a hostage to this airline’s whims and they will just do as they please because you have no options. Will avoid this airline in the future. If you must fly with them I would suggest non-stop only. And good luck if they honor that!
704,"✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Columbus. I've consistently had an excellent experience with Southwest Airlines, having flown them dozens of times over two decades. I live in the DC area and appreciate the number of nonstop routes from the area. While their fares are no longer the least expensive, their customer service is light years ahead of competing US-based airlines. If you have an extenuating circumstance outside of their policy, they provide more sympathy and do their best to offer solutions. They allow maximum flexibility by allowing you to keep what you paid for a flight even if your plans change up to the time of your flight. An added bonus is the free checked bags, drink coupons they provide to frequent flyers on a periodic basis, and the free on-board entertainment through Southwest Wifi."
705,✅ Trip Verified |  Minneapolis to Cincinnati via Chicago. Very poorly trained customer service representatives. Was told different policies by various reps regarding military travel. Customer relations rep put me on hold multiple times to look into issue and then came back and contradicted herself twice. Bottom line I’m out $200 for travel paid to Southwest I was told I’d be able to use at a later date.
706,"✅ Trip Verified |  Please be cautious when you are purchasing Wanna Get Away airline tickets right now. I had purchased two tickets for some friends to come visit me in Philadelphia on my Southwest Credit Card. We were planning on going to New York; however, due to the coronavirus, they are afraid to come now and rightfully so. I purchased the tickets under my name and I was told by Southwest Airlines that I am not able to transfer those tickets to my name with no exception, so I am losing $976.92 because this was their only opportunity to come visit me and they cannot come at a later date. These tickets are non refundable and non transferrable so be aware. With everything that is going on right now, it is probably best not to purchase these tickets right now. You will lose your money if you have to cancel."
707,✅ Trip Verified |  Nashville to Ft. Lauderdale. I had to buy a seat for my service dog the other day at the counter While checking in. Even though they knew he was traveling with me. I even called two days prior to make sure everything was still ok and they mentioned nothing... so $239 later he got on the plane and laid at my feet. Then another couple asked if they could sit with us and I said yes. Southwest said that the seat could not be refunded even though he didn’t take up a seat nor have I ever had to pay before with another airline... even though the federal law states the “airlines May not charge pst fees or other relevant charges” So if you are traveling with your Service animal you might want to ask Southwest about any hidden fees.
708,Not Verified |  Kudos to Southwest! My flight got rerouted due to Heavy Fog in Atlanta So went to Birmingham AL to refuel and one of the Pilots opened a window and then couldn’t get it closed. Long story short I should have been in Phoenix by noon missed my connection had to go back to Orlando to get flight home to Phoenix! They gave us all a voucher and food voucher everyone was so extremely nice!! My day should have been 7 hours ended up 20 hours. My bag made it to Phx by the time I arrived. Outstanding work by all. Called into southwest this morning and talked to Vasa one of the consultants she’s Amazing too. I will be flying Southwest again soon. 
709,✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas to St. Louis. St. Louis baggage handling office thinks it funny and laugh about my luggage being soak and wet. Staff was of no help and certainly not the normal southwest employee. Bad attitude and does care about concern. There is no way my luggage should have gotten this wet. Other than dropping my luggage on the ground there is no excuse for this. I watch you baggage handler mishandle bags all the time and this time it was mine.
710,"✅ Trip Verified |  St. Louis to Austin. The young lady that checked us in was very rude and nasty because when she first called row A and active duty military, we approached her presented ticket and military ID she said ""Oh we no longer take active duty military without uniform"". We stated that's not how you called it that's why where standing here, she said the policy just changed, so I went ahead and looked this up and it states ""Southwest gives special consideration to active duty military personnel. Any active-duty military passenger will be able to board after the A group regardless of their assigned boarding position."""
711,"✅ Trip Verified |  Detroit to Puerto Vallarta via Denver. On our flight to Puerto Vallarta our group of six was divided into different groups and we were told it was because we checked I'm later than others. Checked in exactly 24 hours in advance on our return flight. there were six travelers, all were shown to be in group A, But when we got to the airport we were separated, 5 in group b I was in group C. Our connecting flight 5 were in group A, I was in group C, when asked why the women said it was because of when we checked in. We even set an alarm while on vacation so we could all check in together to avoid being split up like on our previous flights. We asked if I could board with my husband and the attendant told us to it was not allowed and to file a complaint with the company. This is the first and last time I fly with Southwest Airlines. We were treated very rudely and were dismissed by the staff. I will tell all of my friends an post our experience on social media. I would rather pay a little more to be assured I am sitting with my husband."
712,"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas  to Atlanta. This was the best flight, they was all so helpful and had amazing customer service. I would highly recommend southwest over any of the other flights I had been on . This crew works great together and it shows."
713,Not Verified |  Our International flight arrived late into Baltimore. I ran from customs in E concourse to re-check my bag at A concourse to head home to Jacksonville. By the time I got there to check my bag the flight was already boarding. There was confusion as to whether or not I had to re-check my bag with the International or Domestic counter. They could tell I was getting upset and jut wanted to get home. The woman late checked my bag and told me there was no guarantee it would make it on my flight that night. When I landed in Jacksonville my bags were there. The Southwest team had unknowingly made the end of my trip a good one. They hustled you ensure my bags would be on my flight home. Thank you Southwest!
714,✅ Trip Verified |  Baltimore to Boston. Purchased a drink on flight. Should never have served the drink because they only gave us 5 minutes to drink it! Was told the receipt would be available online. It was not available on 2/12. Tried again today: entered confirmation code and flight dates and no receipt was found! Waited 20 minutes for a call back from SW (promised less than 15). First tier told me nothing could be done until Monday morning. Asked to speak to a manager. She said she could look it up on southwest.com. Why didn't the first tier offer that? She is still looking while I type this review.
715,"✅ Trip Verified |  Atlanta to Denver. First time flying southwest (and last). Got to Atlanta airport about one hour early. Got checked in, bags checked, and then the slowest TSA line ever. Anyway Southwest has a policy of giving up tickets if you are not at the gate ten minutes before flight. We arrived at the gate nine minutes before the flight. Our seats were given away to the already over sold flight. Now our family of four is having a day at the Atlanta airport."
716,"✅ Trip Verified | I've been sitting on the plane for the past 2 hours. And that is following 3 hours of delays in the terminal. They are too heavy. This is ridiculous! Horrible management! They are removing luggage but OMG! SWA is becoming worse than the rest! Most US carriers suck, but, come on!"
717,✅ Trip Verified |  Kansas City to Chicago. Horrible customer service and terrible communication. Everyone between Kansa City and Chicago who work for that airlines seemed irritated that we dare bother them while flying their airline.
718,✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Nashville. Never get Early Bird Check-in! It’s a scam. Bought this for $25 to “get a better boarding position and automatic check-in” 36 hours before the flight but only got B28. Really?!? Which means 88 other people also got this and I did not really get a “better boarding position” for my $25. Even spoke with Felicia the supervisor who tried to defend this deceitful practice and said she couldn’t refund or do anything about it. I travel every week for work and from now on Delta will be my choice airline.
719,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ontario to Seattle. As always, a great experience. This is truly the ""People's"" airline in that they treat you like a human being and don't purely operate to extract every last bit of profit at the expense of the passenger. I love that there's no first class, as an average seat is as good as business class on other airlines (minus food - but who relies on airline food these days anyway). Also fantastic is their no-hassle change policy. For my most recent flight, I had to change it twice. No fees, no problems. Also, two free bags checked; what's not to like!"
720,"Not Verified |  Dallas to Little Rock. I looked forward to flying with Southwest as I have never been on any of their flights before. They do not fly up to the Greatland so no chance to do so. I waited about 4 hours for my flight after arriving from Portland. I wandered around the airport, grabbed a doughnut and coffee at Dunkins and chilled with a new book. An hour prior to departing I got my ticket, dropped of by bag and was quite impressed with the employees attitudes. What I was not impressed with was the very overcrowded gate area. I had never seen how Southwest loaded their aircraft before. It seemed to be kind of crazy at first but it worked out fine. The pilot came out and thanked us for choosing to go with him to Detroit. He was then reminded to get us to LIT and he said with a laugh that he would try. I was fortunate enough to sit by one of their pilots who was deadheading home. We chatted most of the way. The flight attendants did a great job getting drinks and chips out to those who wanted them .. short flight, up and down in 42 minutes. Bottom line, great service, fast flight and good humor ... all in all, very nicely done!"
721,"✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to Burbank. They canceled our flight after check-in at the airport. They have my email and cell#, and nothing, no notification. We only noticed because the boarding was late 5min. Rebooked on another flight, but now late to get home, and lousy boarding position. Agent at the gate just shrugs their shoulders. Terrible customer service. They don't even care. They are calloused to customers' complaining about their terrible service."
722,"✅ Trip Verified |  Denver to Houston. Our flight was delayed, by 2 hours, and their only explanation was ""it was an upper management decision"". After finally boarding our flight, we sat at our terminal, boarded, for another hour before setting off. There was absolutely no explanation. Never flying Southwest again."
723,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tampa to San Jose via Ft Lauderdale. Awful and unconfortable experience. Disgusting flight with a fly flying around us all the time. The open seating policy, is very disappointed, the attendant is not able to help you if you want to seat near a family therefore you have to pay $40 for each seat for each flight. Please keep in mind that when you buy your ticket this will increase the amount of it therefore your luggage never will be ""free"". Nothing is free when you flight with Southwest. My worst experience flying. Avoid this airline."
724,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tampa to Havana. I had very bad experience today with the crew at the check in point counter because they have a wrong information, i almost lost my flight because they were saying that i can not have a child bicycle in my luggage when a call the airline several times asking and they said yes and also every time that i fly i ask in the checking counter and they let me know as long as fix in your luggage is fine so i think they need a better training before they make decisions that they don't really know i was thinking in never fly again in this airline because this bad experience."
725,✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience ever with South West airlines Houston. I waited at baggage claim for over 30 minutes for my bag which never came while over the speaker the announcer called for the owner of a crown royal bag. As you may know Crown Royal is a liquor that comes in a purple and gold bag but this couldn’t be my bag even though it was purple and gold it clearly said Betsy Johnson all over it. I guess that was a funny joke for the employees to yell on the loud speaker that owner of a crown royal bag needed to come to the service desk. After realizing my bag was not coming I was directed to a room in the back where I inquired about the location of the bag. The airport staff then said oh you’re the owner of the Crown Royal bag and began to giggle. They informed that my bag fell and was ran over and some of my stuff have been destroyed with not even the smallest hint of remorse. My bag was literally destroyed to the point all the clothes and shoes In it were ripped to shreds / destroyed. When I became angry the south west employee asked me “what are you so mad about it’s not like we are not going to cut you a check”. I explained to the worker that I am in a city I have never been to with absolutely nothing to wear and all my belongings destroyed. The employee began to tell me how southwest is a million dollar company & they have no problem cutting a check as if this was suppose to make me feel better. The employee then told me it happens all the time due to southwest handling so much luggage on a daily basis and they just cut a check. The employees asked me to go through my bag and damages and asked me to price the cost of each item. The south west employee sat on the computer googled my items one by one while making comments like “ woah you really paid $200 for that ?” and arguing with me over the amount I paid for each item saying things like “ well they have it for cheaper at this store”. The worker also went as far to turn to his employee and say “ I don’t even argue with these people” After the employee calculated what he felt I deserved for my belongings he wrote a check for $620 and told me I should just go to the mall & buy new items. The employee told me I can go to chase bank and cash the check the same day which was a lie. I went to chase bank and they told me they could not cash check because southwest had to verify it and no one answered the phone. I was not able to cash check until I returned home from my vacation. The customer service was absolutely terrible and this was a major I’m convenience and embarrassing experience. I do not recommend Southwest Airlines to any one.
726,"✅ Trip Verified |  Omaha to Chicago via Orlando. My sister and I got separated from our group on a flight and with each group of us having an hour to two hour delays on our first flight our connecting flight where we were suppose to meet would have separate us again. Deborah was more than helpful in switching our flights for both parties. She was so kind, accommodating, and super happy during a rather frustrating time. Deborah's attitude was the only highlight of a very frustrating travel experience. The rest of the staff were short and less than helpful or pleasant. That flight that we then got switched to, thanks to Deborah, then had another two hour delay."
727,"Not Verified | New York to New Orleans via Houston. This flight has been such a pain for me, my mother, and my 9 year old sister. We are on our way to a cheer competition for my sister and have had our fight delayed almost an hour and a half on the fault of the employees not checking IDs correctly. My sister is very upset and is afraid we will miss our connecting flight from Houston to New Orleans and miss her competition together. This has been an awful experience for my sisters first time flying. Thank you Southwest Airlines for a stressful and painful flying experience for me and the rest of my family."
728,"Not Verified |  Berrien Springs to San Jose. Great airline. Southwest was the best flying experience for me. The flight attendants were very nice and when I asked for a drink, they kept offering more until I was good to go. Since I was on a morning flight they offered coffee without anyone having to ask. But I do have a complaint. On my flight back home, I kept getting disconnected from their wifi for some reason. And others around me had a solid connection. If Southwest can look into this problem I will give entertainment a better review. But other than that, totally worth the price I paid."
729,"✅ Trip Verified | Nashville to Denver. Staff did an excellent job keeping the trip light, and fun. They were happy to help accommodate the needs of many travelers and were professional in their work. 10/10 review, way to go y'all!"
730,"Not Verified |  Denver to Washington. Great airline, their flight attendants were friendly, service was fast, beautiful airplane, clean, and not run down. Great disability service."
731,"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Milwaukee. First time trying the on-board 'live TV' and 'wifi' service. Live TV Service was miserable - unable to use it at all. Service either wouldn't start, or when it did, would only play a couple of seconds and then quit. Tried the wifi instead, and while I was able to read a couple of E-Mails, the service was too slow to be useful for anything else. I was very disappointed."
732,✅ Trip Verified |  San Jose to Denver. Customer service was terrible. I always get to stand in family boarding line with my two kids since I’m flying alone with my kids. My kids are ages 13 and 7. The lady at the door made me get out of line with my kids and did not allow me to get on the plane with family boarding. I’ve never encountered this problem before and I did not appreciate her separating us. We had to sit away from one another and my daughter cried in the plane the whole flight. I hope that makes the damn door lady happy. She must not have kids. Very unsatisfying customer service today.
733,✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Austin. Warning to Active Duty Military! Their boarding policy regarding us is you must be in uniform. However they are  wish washy when it comes to this policy. Some flights I get on after A group it’s the family boarding and some I’m turned away. Even with my Military ID. 
734,"Not Verified |  It would have been nice to know that I actually can't pick up my minor from the gate as promised by Southwest Airlines. After everything closes at Will Roger's you cant go any further then the ticketing area. I specifically called Southwest and asked if I pick her up from the gate and they said yes. They said nothing about if TSA is closing you have to wait outside. This is the first time my little girl has flown alone and I gave her specific Instructions to wait for me at the gate not the front of the airport. A little disappointed that this was not mentioned. I was not the only mom waiting for their minor that was upset by this. I know we all looked through the instructions on how to fly a minor , but when I call to ask a specific question to the airline to make sure I didnt miss anything, nothing was mentioned about TSA closing and possibly not being able to pick up minors from the gate."
735,"✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Denver via Dallas. I've even had better luck flying on United, and that's saying a lot considering United's abysmal reputation! To begin with my stories - Most recent flight, October 2019, Denver back to Houston: Unremarkable flight. Southwest check-in agent in Denver who collected my checked baggage was ""mechanically"" professional but lacked much in the way of personality. Upon arrival at Houston, baggage was oh, so slow to come out! Second most recent flight, October 2019, Houston via Dallas to Denver: Southwest check-in agent in Houston who collected my checked baggage was ""mechanically"" professional, again. Gate agents in both Houston and Dallas acted quite bored, honestly. I didn't notice the splotches of dried drink, food chunks and blood (yes, that is correct, blood) surrounding my seat until I sat down, and I had to sit down because I was one of the last people to board the plane. I sent Southwest a scathing review of that flight and got a $75 credit for a future flight for what it's worth. Third most recent flight, May 2019, Austin to Albuquerque then back to Austin: Any Southwest staff I interacted with at either airport couldn't be paid enough, it seems, to even bother to pleasantly interact with staff. That said, I remember the pilot on the first leg, from Austin to Albuquerque, trying to engage the passengers, so good for him! Fourth most recent flight, October 2018, Dallas to Louisville: The man who checked in my baggage at the curb barely said a word or even grunted, and even fairly forcefully threw said baggage onto the carousel even after I had told him that I have fragile items within! No ""thank you,"" no ""this is your ticket and go this way to your gate,"" nothing! Southwest's overall concept of customer service has plummeted over the last decade, and, after October 2019, I'll absolutely no longer fly them unless they are significantly cheaper than any competitor."
736,"Not Verified | St. Louis to Seattle. Our flight was delayed by two hours but as I sat in the waiting gate I witnessed some of the most genuine employees of Southwest. I was sitting in gate E24 near the “help desk” and couldn’t help but overhear the employees talking. Anytime an employee walked by or came up to the help desk they were greeted with a big smile and a hug. They asked everyone how their holiday was, how their family was and just how that person was doing. It was so nice and sincere and you could tell they really cared and everyone got along well. Not only were they kind to each other they were also so kind to every single customer they had even people who were frustrated and not so nice. Usually, employees gather around and talk bad about the really annoying customers but none of them ever did. Everyone seemed to be in a really good mood and it was really nice to see such good, happy employees."
737,"Not Verified |  I want to point out how amazing their staff did with all of the 1st communication. 2nd and how much i had faith in them. On December 28th I was supposed to fly out of Denver into Dallas then onto Amarillo, and at that time Denver had just gotten some snow and cold weather, and the first thing they addressed was that I might not be able to get on my second flight to Amarillo because the time frame was to small, being that they would like more than an hour between, I had about 45 minutes in between, and the time just kept getting shorter and shorter. So we rebooked my flight for January 1st -  on January 1st, I was about 20 minutes away from missing my flight, maybe less, but I was aware that they said my luggage may or may not be there when I get to my final destination, in Amarillo, because of how short of time there was. But now that my flight is over I do indeed have all of my luggage, I would just like to applaud Denver International airport with the highest standards forbeing so communicative. Thank you for everything that y’all have done on my little journey!"
738,"✅ Trip Verified |  Detroit to Phoenix. Had the most wonderful experience on my flight home today, with today being a holiday and an early Flight I was not looking forward to traveling especially with a sleepy and grumpy toddler but the flight attendant James made a dreaded experience into a relaxing, stress free and comical adventure. He was upbeat, kind and friendly and engaging with my little one and his humor aboard the flight made me laugh and feel at ease. It’s the little things that makes the difference and he nailed it. The icing on the cake he said goodbye to my daughter and still chatted with her and he got Lucky and she blew him a kiss. Anyone who crosses paths with him is indeed lucky, you will not be disappointed."
739,"✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix to Los Angeles. I had the worse experience with Southwest on Dec 17. Flight was delayed for mechanical issues and I have a disability that requires medication to be taken timely. I checked my meds under the plane since this was the simplest route LAX to PHX. I let the customer service know my meds went to be put under plane they were rude and extremely rude. Told me my meds were at baggage to retrieve and got down there on my scooter and it wasn’t there nor did they even know anything about me getting my meds. Had to go back through security. Sent in a complaint on 12/17/19 someone was supposed to call me within 48 hrs never did. Called them several times and all they say is a special team is working on it. Here it is 12/31/19 and no one not anyone from Southwest has called me. Just sad, disappointed and upset at this."
740,"✅ Trip Verified | Oakland to Denver. Southwest's Oakland desk agents are fantastic, and provided the best experience I've had with an airline. I brought my cat in a carry on that was too big. The agent checking me in tried her best to let me by, but it clearly wouldn't fit. So she quickly snuck in the back and gave me a free Southwest pet carrier. She could have easily followed strict protocol and ruined my and others holiday, but did her best to make sure we'd make our flight. That level of service has made Southwest my number 1 airline."
741,"Not Verified |  Southwest really “flew the extra mile” today in terms of demonstrating just how terrible they are at customer service. After a 1.5 hr delay in leaving the West Coast, they informed passengers that they had informed the connecting flights to wait a bit so that passengers could make their connections. We land in the Midwest and I rush to my connection, only to find out that 1) No one had bothered to inform this flight crew that there were delayed passengers rushing to catch this flight; 2) my plane was literally sitting right there, on the other side of the glass, and they refused to let me on because they had already counted the passengers; 3) the next connection was 3.5 hours later - but oh wait that was delayed another 1.5 hrs too. So even though the two flights that I needed to catch were more than 1.5 hours delayed, they couldn’t hold this one for a few minutes. And then, when they gave me a ticket for the last flight of the day, they put me on one of the last groups for seating, and because Southwest doesn’t assign seats then it just means you will have a horrible seat. I pressed and they gave me seating after the first group. Fast forward four hours later on a late Sunday evening after traveling all day, and it looks like a small group of passengers DID get to board before everyone because they were from a connecting flight. So apparently, Southwest does not care at all if it’s one or a few persons being royally screwed by every one of their actions. All the while, the staff who answered my questions responded curtly, seemed annoyed, and one manager simply stared at me and asked what I wanted in deadpan voice after the person at the desk explained the situation. A friendly service reminder to never, ever fly this airline that doesn’t care the least bit for individual customer experiences."
742,"Not Verified |  I will never fly with Southwest Airlines again. Our trip was flat out cancelled in March when all of the 737 debacle happened. Not their fault. They kindly gave us an $800 flight credit to use in the next year. We saved it so that we could go and see family over the holidays. I booked it 6 weeks ago, so I could get the times I wanted. Got 2 text messages this morning delaying the flight to Dallas so that we missed our connection to Amarillo. Had to re-book and now we lost a day of time with my family. We had to get a hotel room in Amarillo because we are getting in so late and had to delay our car rental. The customer service lady was extremely rude and really couldn't care less. Oh and to add to it - I refreshed the flight information on the Southwest website. The flight time was changed back to a good time where we could have made the connection, but by the time I called they had already sold all of the seats. I guess we should have risked it and just gone to the airport hoping that something would work out. Southwest offered nothing, not even an apology for the missed time and extra money we had to spend."
743,"✅ Trip Verified | Las Vegas to Rochester via Baltimore. On these two flights, I noticed that the flight attendants were less comedic than on previous Southwest flights. However, they were also kind and accommodating. During the Las Vegas flight, many of us fell asleep shortly after takeoff, and the flight attendants were very much willing to serve us beverages and snacks later on when we requested them. When I ordered a lemon-lime sparkling water with no ice, the flight attendant who served it to me added in a lime wedge and a famous Southwest ""heart stirrer."" Nice touch! Otherwise, things were the same as during previous flights: the underwhelming shortbread cookies and Fritos for the long flight and the pretzels for the short flight, and inflight entertainment only accessible via personal electronic devices. The flight also arrived approximately on time. All in all a good experience."
744,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rochester to Providence via Baltimore. These two flights took place amidst the winter storm which struck the Northeast in early December of 2019. As usual, for these short flights, we were offered beverages and pretzels. The gate agents for both flights were excellent and got us boarded quickly, but the issue was that we were delayed for both flights due to de-icing and such. The flight attendants did a good job of balancing the occasional need for speed with the need for passenger respect. Not a whole lot of joking around during these flights, too, but given the circumstances, I suppose that should not be surprising. We arrived at each location about 30 to 45 minutes late. All things considered, I think that was quite impressive! After flying with Southwest for nine flights over the span of about a week and a half, I can say that one area in which they are excellent is in getting you where you need to go on time. This is one area where they really do outperform JetBlue, and to me, it matters a lot!"
745,"✅ Trip Verified | Rochester to Las Vegas via Baltimore and Salt Lake City. The flight from Rochester to Baltimore was operated on a Boeing 737-700, while the flight from Baltimore to Salt Lake City (and onward to Las Vegas) was operated on a Boeing 737-800. We had some comedians as flight attendants on these flights! The first two kind of struggled to get us to laugh. The third, however was absolutely hilarious! I noticed several indirect advertisements for Southwest's new flights to Hawaii through joking we had just landed in Hawaii. The flight from Rochester to Baltimore featured the usual beverage service and packet of pretzels, as did the flight from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas. For the flight from Baltimore to Salt Lake City (which was much longer), there were two beverage services, and we were offered shortbread cookies or Fritos, or both. As usual, inflight entertainment was available, but only if you had a streaming device with you. I don't know why, but for some reason, I felt like the flight attendants on the first two of these flights were a little less friendly than I've experienced in the past on Southwest. Not hostile, but just kind of passive-yet also a little impatient with passengers as they boarded (like during previous flights). I guess my biggest gripe is the food. I know it's a low-cost carrier, and I know it's a domestic flight in the U.S. But somehow, for a flight that lasts for something like five hours, I feel like people really ought to be offered more than just a couple of packets of snacks. (Yes, I am absolutely spoiled by Asian carriers, which offer full hot meals on such flights!)"
746,"✅ Trip Verified |  Providence to Rochester via Baltimore. Two quick flights, and pretty much without incident. I was accompanying my parents, and one of them (my Dad) needed special assistance. For some reason, the gate agent in Providence said only one person was allowed to accompany my Dad during preboarding. My Mom opted to do so. The gate agent in Baltimore, however, said both my Mom and I could accompany my Dad during preboarding. During the flights, complimentary beverages were offered, as were packets of pretzels. Apparently wi-fi is available, as well as a few movies if you brought your tablet or smartphone or whatever to watch them on. The flight attendants were generally pleasant, but seemed a little bit impatient at times. I recognize that these were short flights and that they had schedules to keep (which they did indeed keep, to their credit), but it seemed like people generally were not going particularly slowly as it was, despite Southwest's unique boarding technique of having people choose their own seats. Overall, though, pretty good, and it certainly beats flying American or United!"
747,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ontario to Denver. Take their no show policy seriously. Ten hours travel, my elderly mother appeared to have a stroke and was transported to a local emergency room. Numerous tests were being done because of the concern for her wellbeing, and the doctor was less than sure about what the cause was. Being an only child, I stayed with my mom during this process, getting her to agree to treatment, explaining what the doctors were telling her, and trying to keep her calm. The furthest thing from my mind was our planned travel to go to her college friends funeral in Colorado. While they were doing a procedure, I got the email that we missed the flight - that is how fast time flied. I immediately called, and they said it was too late, but that I should contact the corporate consumer line. Much later that day, when I left the hospital, I immediately went to the airport, and they also recommended that I contact the corporate consumer line. The staff member at the airport was understanding and encouraged me to reach out because the company is known to make exceptions. So I did. In response was an automatic, non-empathetic, “you didn’t meet our rules email”. It was clear the author never read anything I wrote, that the author never came close to the sympathy advanced by phone representative or airport representative. That the author utilized the cut and paste function to get through its tasks. The moral of the review - keep the southwest number on your favorites if you are traveling. That you have a sick family member in the emergency room is not a reason to miss the deadline or not call them to cancel. That their mission statement claiming “dedication to the highest quality of Customer Service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness” are words on a website, not words that consider any tragedy that may befall you or your family, unless they can advertise it for their advantage. My mom and I are nobodies to a big institution like this, so be careful, you will be too."
748,"✅ Trip Verified | I have been fairly disappointed with Southwest in the last several months. I routinely fly multiple times a month between Sacramento and Los Angeles (Burbank) for work. My last 4 flights in a row, starting mid-November, have been delayed by an hour or more. And today it has already been delayed 40 minutes. It has begun to really interrupt my ability to make dependable plans. I have been a rewards member for a year, and I am looking to stop using southwest for all flights. For many months there was not a problem at all. But the last 2 months have been delay after delay. Very unfortunate they can not maintain the schedules flight times. I will begin to look to other companies for better reliability."
749,"Not Verified |  San Jose to Boise. I am really disappointed about how Southwest handles transfer of miles to friends and family. I just gifted my adult son 10,000 miles and it cost me $100.00 to do so! I wanted him to have the freedom to use them as he wished. I decided to go ahead and pay but next time it would seem better for me to purchase his ticket and use my miles. I have never gifted miles before so maybe it's standard practice. Regardless I know I won't be doing that again. Not worth it! In general I use Southwest and enjoy the benefits of free luggage and refundable tickets."
750,Not Verified |  St Louis to Fort Lauderdale. I do believe southwest just set a company record. A three owner flight has now turned into a 18 hour nightmare. Since we left St. Louis we have had eight delays. We are going to miss our family cruise. Sitting in a plane waiting for their next delay. To make matters worse we tried to get off and drive to port. Now Southwest Airlines employees are telling us they don’t know what plane our luggage is on. Still stuck in a nightmare!
751,"Not Verified |  Today our 3 pm flight was cancelled for no apparent reason. Luckily we were able to book a 2 pm flight. We arrived at the airport with an hour to spare to find the southwest computers had been down for 13 hours. We had to wait in a line for 3.5 hours that wrapped three times around the inside of the airport as every single passenger had to be checked in manually. Then were put on standby for a different connecting flight which we were able to obtain seats. Unfortunately that plane was 90 minutes delayed, causing us to miss our connecting flight by 2 minutes. The connecting flight departed 10 minutes early as we watched it take flight. There are no flights home for us tonight after we just missed the last one. Meanwhile we are offered a $100 travel voucher which won’t even cover a hotel tonight. Now we have been waiting over an hour to speak to a supervisor."
752,"Not Verified |  Omaha to Manchester. Johnny Lopez helped us twice for this trip. Our flight from Omaha to Chicago was delayed to the point where we would miss our connecting flight. We stood in line with lots of other folks to get rescheduled for the next day and when it was our turn, Johnny was friendly and efficient and wished us a Happy Holidays. The next evening when we came back, he was working at the ticket desk and remembered us, helped us out and again wished us a Happy Holiday. Everyone, even the woman in the luggage area apologized profusely for the inconvenience. SWA is my preferred carrier and that’s the reason why"
753,"✅ Trip Verified |  St Louis to Atlanta. Great prices and good at having available flights. My only issue is they lag everything I fly. Always delayed flights, Today I waited 20 mins at the boarding line for them to board us. I also waited 40 mins for my bags to come to baggage claim. I got places to go."
754,"✅ Trip Verified |  I took a beautiful trip to Jamaica- with no help from Southwest Airlines! They cancelled, then delayed, then cancelled, then delayed our original flight from Buffalo to Baltimore. They did schedule us for another flight to get to Jamaica, but leaving the next day! I work and don't just have vacation time to throw around because you delay my flight at 9 am and then can't do anything until the next day- really? I went and asked to be rebooked and we made it to Florida- not Jamaica that day, causing me to miss a day of vacation. We got $400 for that, so ok, I guess that's fine. But then we had to return home. On the way home, both flights were hours delayed and then they completely busted my checked luggage. We were also not allowed to get up during basically the whole 3 hour flight to use the restroom. I feel like telling them to take their $400 flight vouchers and shove it. They can give me cash because I don't plan on flying Southwest again. If you have planes, fly them, we're not paying for a service where the business doesn't hold up their end of the bargain, and that's what happened, if we book to fly certain days and times, the o ky thing affecting that should be weather, not mechanical issues and late planes. I'm beyond frustrated as having flights messed up can really destroy your trip. Nice try, Southwest- looking very forward to a call to your customer service tomorrow if I'm home by then!"
755,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Orlando. Don’t usually fly Southwest but my colleague suggested since it was for a more affordable price. Do not like the way they have seating arrangements because you aren’t able to board with who you are traveling with unless the boarding agent is a pleasant person which mine was not. And also on my way to my destination I was allowed to board outside of my seating position due to the fact I am active military, but on the way back I was not because I was not in uniform. If I’m on vacation why would I have on my uniform and it also is not safe to travel in uniform. But that is just my experience. I will not be flying with this airline anymore."
756,"San Antonio to Phoenix. I cannot count the times I am constantly delayed with Southwest, today was no exception. Poor updates, slow customer service and a wasted day due to poor planning by the airline. Disappointing and will no longer use their services."
757,"Not Verified |  I am very aggravated with Southwest Airlines. We were on the plane headed to our cruise in Mexico about a month ago, something went wrong with the plane (which we were understanding because things like this happen that are out of anybody’s control). Southwest customer service was not helpful in trying to figure out how to get to our next destination. They kept ignoring us and promising us multiple vouchers while we were at the airport (that we have yet to receive). We took matters into our own hands, and at this point we had to figure out another way to get to Mexico through a different airline. Southwest promised us a refund, & vouchers (probably hoping to keep our mouth shut) but it’s been a month now & we haven’t received a single thing from them. Altogether my friends and I spent $5,000 or more that weekend because of Southwest and they can’t even give us a $75 refund for our flight. Never flying through Southwest Airlines again."
758,"✅ Trip Verified | I had probably the worst experience with Southwest. Here is what happened: On December 1, 2019, I was flying from Baltimore to Las Vegas. By the time I got onto the plane, all the compartments are full. Then the flight attendant took my luggage and seated me in one of the front seats. After all the passengers moved out, I started looking for my bag but couldn’t find it anywhere. Then I asked for the flight attended where she put my luggage, she wasn’t able to find it either. Long story short, after calling Southwest customer service representatives, I was finally offered a $75 voucher for my lost luggage which they call it ‘for apologies’. I can’t imagine $75 dollars for my lost carry-on bag. I don’t recommend anyone to fly Southwest, if you have to fly prepare for the worst."
759,Not Verified |  San Diego to Phoenix. First flight was delayed over 30 minutes. Plane flying in was late. A day later returning home was seated promptly but plane was delayed over an hour. Not a great first impression of Southwest Airlines.
760,"✅ Trip Verified |  In mid September, my husband and I took a short flight from Oakland to Portland, as we were moving up to our new place in Portland. I packed my wedding flatware, which I use for special occasions in my check in luggage, thinking that if I added it to my carry on, they could consider it to be dangerous. Up to this point, the other issue I had with Southwest over luggage was a few years ago when they smashed up my Samsonite luggage from OAK to Long Beach. They did correct the situation by reimbursing me for the damage. However, when I arrived at PDX and our new place, I did not unpack all of my luggage immediately, since we had 4 bags between the two of us. A few days after we landed, I looked for my flatware and found it was missing, except for the butter knives. Someone took out the 12 dinner forks, 12 salad forks, 12 Soup spoons and 12 teaspoons, I called Southwest right away and was told that they would process the claim. When I called customer service, I begged and pleaded for them to find it and return it to me. I don't even want the money for the flatware, I just wanted the flatware because it was sentimental to me. SouthWest said someone could have taken it out of my luggage and not returned it to its place and that many times it ends up at a lost and found in Atlanta. Well, I put in a claim, sent a letter and asked them to check in Atlanta. ALL I wanted was my flatware. it wasn't extremely expensive, but it was Mikasa and it had been discontinued. They denied my claim and when I appealed the denial, they sent me a letter stating that they cannot reimburse everyone for what they ""claim"" they lost and hoped that I would not give them bad online reviews because of it."
761,"✅ Trip Verified |  Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale was my 1st flight in 23 years due to PTS from a white-knuckle Washington-RDU ValuJet flight, the month after the 592 disaster, that suffered engine trouble right over Raleigh that badly scared me. The attendants especially Steve and Christie (who me & my big brother in the rear saw most) lived up to their title, doling out instructions & the meager excuse for food and drinks, in a professionally caring and friendly manner. The atmosphere was convivial & untroubled by complaints or aircraft/crew problems. This airborne adventure bookending a Carnival cruise, after such a long time & many industry changes therein, was one which the crews involved truly highlighted with their skills & friendly, engaging service. rrow"" finishes which can be described as a landing only charitably - & not leave passengers marinating in their buckled seats (I didn't) for long minutes waiting for the gate!"
762,"✅ Trip Verified | I took this quick trip to FL to visit my sister and help out with her friendsgiving dinner. I sat in an aisle seat and a woman sat at the window seat. It was a full flight however our middle seat was vacant somehow. I started a new medication the day before and I had taken it as well as my regular pain medicine. Being it was an early flight I had not eaten breakfast. I did have water and snacks with me on the plane if I got hungry. I started to feel hot and a little faint and it intensified to almost passing out. The woman next to me who turned out to be a spectacular nice friendly woman immediately came to my assistance. She made me eat something and she was fanning me hoping that I would not pass out. I was within minutes of doing so. The stewardesses on board were also spectacular! They asked for a nurse or doctor on board and luckily for me there was a physicians assistant directly behind me. She came over to me, took care of me, checked my blood pressure, listened to my heart and made sure that I was going to be OK. After drinking some orange juice and having some snacks my blood pressure did go down and I started to feel somewhat normal again. I never did pass out thankfully and was able to enjoy the rest of my flight and the great conversation. I can’t say enough about all four of those people who immediately came to my aid no questions asked. They were all happy to take care of me."
763,✅ Trip Verified |  Tampa to Las Vegas. Theres one staff working on this flight that I recommend be taught some serious customer service skills that he is clearly lacking. Also to be told that you guys are one of the fastest airlines boarding and arriving was a complete lie after being delayed to board and having to wait for a gate on arrival.
764,"Not Verified |  Nashville to San Diego. Southwest has stepped it up. Ease of checkin quick security lines, expedited seating, comfortable seating with wifi and movie access. Finally a couple snack. Entire travel to and from vacation a pure joy. Arrived early on both arrivals. They've done a great job throughout all levels. Thank you for a great experience."
765,"Not Verified | Baltimore to San Diego. Don’t waste your money on spending $25 for Southwest Airlines Early Bird option. I bought it nearly one week ago, but it did not show up as assigned at the 24 hour point. So I checked in myself at the exact 24 hour point. I got B02 - that’s what I think. I would get checking in at 24 hours, not a week in advance. They say no, you had early check-in. OK, that sounds fishy, whatever. But you maybe get B20-B30 tops if you check-in. Save the $25."
766,"Not Verified | Spokane to San Jose. I have gone on Southwest airlines since I was 3 years old and I think its a great airline because it doesn't charge for baggage, and I love the drink selection. Something bad that happened on this airline is that once I left my jacket on the plane, and the person we asked for help wasn't very nice or helpful, but I did get my jacket back."
767,"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Salt Lake City. The Crew on flight 1227 was amazing.  They were very hospitable and did an excellent job at making everyone feel relaxed. The pilot also flew the plane very smoothly. I have a weak stomach, but it almost felt like I wasn’t even on a plane."
768,"✅ Trip Verified |  Nashville to Las Vegas. Worst airline ever, the free movies and entertainment is useless, the free WiFi is spotty at best and when I applied for paid WiFi it never worked. Seats are incredibly small and close together. I will probably never fly with SW again. I won't mind paying extra if that need be because all other airlines I flown with are so much better."
769,✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Punta Cana. Traveling with my family to Punta Cana. Staff member who was at the gate separated me from my wife and 3 kids and claimed that it is Southwest’s policy to separate parents from their kids. I couldn’t believe that my wife was going to board alone with 3 kids that are less then 3 years old. This would definitely be the very last time I fly with Southwest. This is very sad and someone needs to really fire this rude employee who has no customer service ethics and no family values.
770,Not Verified |  Grand Rapids to Albuquerque. This airline sucks. No space and you can’t sit with your husband because they have no assigned seating. If you get stuck in c and they do not follow the numbers so people cut in front. Miserable flight. I am furious that I am not allowed to sit with my husband and the person next to me is half in my seat. I have never had a more unpleasant miserable flight. I highly recommend never to travel with this airline which has less seat space than most.
771,"✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to Baltimore. Bad airline. Our flight got canceled at the last minute and no one ever called or emailed us. We are supposed to have direct flight but they switched us to 1 stop flight, extended the total flying hours, and pushed our position to bottom. Even worst, when I complained, they tried to give me a run-around, asking me to call many different departments. Terrible. Do not flight with them at all cost."
772,Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Albuquerque. Worst airline ever. They provide no flexibility in regards to flight changes. They make you check your carry ons when there’s multiple open bin spaces. They have been late departing and arriving on each flight I’ve been on. The customer service reps give you insincere apologies. 
773,✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to Kansas City. I have flown Southwest Airlines for around 6 years now about 12 family vacations. After my terrible experience with a overcrowded plane and a rude hostess when trying to get my family seated that clearly told us to sit down. Southwest Airlines has really gone down hill in my opinion.I am no longer going to travel with my family because of this using.
774,"✅ Trip Verified |  Orange County to Denver. I like Southwest overall because of the transparent prices and the fact that they don’t charge extra to switch or cancel a flight. I choose them almost exclusively. However, I recently tried purchasing the inflight WiFi with “free” movies—technically an $8 movie since you have to pay for the WiFi first. I was very disappointed in the inflight entertainment quality. The movie buffered partway through for at least 15-20 minutes, and the audio didn’t match up with the video because of the internet lag. I will be downloading my own entertainment ahead of time from now on. Wish I could have gotten a refund on the WiFi."
775,Not Verified |  When traveling with Southwest I accidentally placed my tablet on the edge of a garbage can forgot and walked into security -a minute later I realized it and ran back but it was gone. I had just started my vacation and was devastated as this was a very special birthday present. I immediately placed a missing report but was frantically trying to cancel all my information loaded in my tablet. A few days into my trip I received an email from Southwest saying they may have found something that belonged to me. For a very small fee I have been reunited with my tablet in perfect condition. I would like to thank the person who turned this in and Southwest airlines for their expert and immediate attention to an item in their possession that was lost. My faith in the kindness of others and honesty of business has been restored -I am very grateful. I highly recommend Southwest Airlines from flying in their planes to the customer service on the ground.
776,"✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to New Orleans. I love Southwest, but I’m very disappointed in one of the flight attendants, MCO-MSY at 11:10 on 10/24. She asked us to make sure our toddler didn’t play with the tray because the people in front of us could feel it. I said okay I’m sorry we will try our best, but he is 18 months and doesn’t quite understand. She then suggested that we move by the other people with kids. Southwest is open seating so I don’t appreciate being asked to move because we have a child. If there were certain rules to where families have to sit somewhere specific then Southwest should put that in place. Otherwise, everyone should be allowed to sit where they please - with children or without."
777,"✅ Trip Verified |  Alex, our flight attendant on our flight from Orlando to Las Vegas on October 19th on flight 3982 was awesome! I’ve never enjoyed a flight so much! He was funny, took his job seriously, and was so attentive to bat. Southwest is lucky to have him and such a wonderful team onboard their planes. The trip was smooth, fun, and I’m without a complaint."
778,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas to Washington. Why does it take so long to get bags? I could have flown another carrier. But still this is ridiculous 30 min. SWA you out here showing LUV, show some here at Washington Regan."
779,"Not Verified |  Dallas to New Orleans. I had 3 flights get canceled so I had to stay in the airport all night - waiting here for 14 hours. I asked Southwest staff for maybe a blanket or pillow and they were extremely rude. Would not recommend this airline, definitely not reliable."
780,"Not Verified |  Baltimore to Pittsburgh. As I boarded this SW flight, and was attempting to get a seat, utilizing Southwest’s ‘open seating’ policy, the attendant blocked me from getting to a seat, stating he was holding the seats for others. Because I asked him repeatedly about the Southwest policy that he was not adhering to, he got loud stating that I need to find another seat. I did and apparently I needed to have a ‘cheery’ disposition, because before I knew it, another attendant was in my face telling me I need to listen to the attendants. I was already in a seat and was lost as to what she was talking about, sure enough another employee who was not even with the crew, comes on board and is now demanding that I verbally answer him, when he tells me I need to listen to the attendants (and no I was not in the emergency exit, nor was I doing any duties for the airline). So yes we are back in kindergarten and I answered him, but that too was not good enough, because he provides his rendition to the captain and I was told to leave the plane. I was not loud, nor drunk, nor physically abusive, I did not raise my voice, nor did I cause a commotion. And now I am told to leave the plane because 1 person, decided to take his frustration out on me. I did nothing wrong to anyone on that plane, nothing wrong to anyone in the airport and Southwest can justify people making decisions like this. If you are frustrated with your job before 9:00am then why does Southwest have morning flights? Clearly the employees do not want to deal with customers during certain hours. And what is even more disheartening, is the fact that they are allowed to document lies and nonsense to cover their end and nowhere is it documented what I went through as a paying customer. I guarantee I would not recommend Southwest to anyone ever."
781,"✅ Trip Verified |  Baltimore to Orlando. I bought Southwest Airlines flight to Orlando thinking it was good as it used to be. I am traveling with a family due to which I carried 4 checked in bags. One of the checked bags had its handle broken, another bag came with a huge dent. Not sure if Southwest Airlines employees were all playing catch or basketball with my bags. By the way at the express check in they expect you to put the claims tags on the bags by yourself. I have never worked for an airline, due to which I tried my best to make sure that the claims label goes on each bag. The lady at Baltimore check in asked me 3-4 times as to why I did not put the labels in a certain way for them to read the label (it was not even bent). I had to tell her that I did this for the first time each time. She wouldn’t stop. Southwest Airlines you better have people at the kiosk to put those claims labels in a professional way.  Just because you are giving us free checked in bags, doesn’t mean that you can do all these damages and don’t even care about that."
782,"Not Verified |  This is the umpteenth time our flight has been delayed a ridiculous amount. Today it is delayed now 3 hours which puts us at our connection at the time it should leave, most likely without us. Southwest used to be the best, easiest, and most convenient and all of that seems to have ended. I choose Southwest for many years now because I’ve always enjoyed the company more than others. Now it’s smartest to go with the most affordable, since the only things that make Southwest stand out anymore are negative. The free bags used to be nice, now it’s cheaper to pay someone to check them. The family boarding used to be nice, now they just let anyone with a minor on at that time, even if the “child” is actually of adult ability. The price used to be nice, now many other airlines are less expensive. The staff used to be nice, now they’re nowhere to be found. Not even one staff member manning the two gates I’m siting at."
783,✅ Trip Verified | I scheduled a flight in May for my September trip. Originally from Orlando. Hurricane was bearing down on Florida and Orlando airport was due to close because of the storm. My tickets were bought and paid for in May. 400$ round trip for 2. At the very last minute before the airport closed I switched my flight to Tampa so I wouldn't miss my trip. Southwest charged me an additional 400$ for the same distance flight that they cancelled 4 hours later when they closed the Orlando airport. Been a Southwest customer for many many years. I will be looking at my options and do what it takes to never use Southwest again.
784,"✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix to El Paso with Southwest Airlines. If you fly with children, expect to be separated and to have your children fly next to adult strangers. They cannot guarantee you will sit with your children, although they try to sell you upgraded boarding. The upgrade also does not guarantee your seating with your family. It's disgusting and reprehensible. Karma is what happened to them with the MAX. Worth it to pay more with another airline and guarantee your seat."
785,"Not Verified |  Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. We boarded the plane only for the pilot to tell us that we couldn’t use the plane anymore because of the window compressor being frozen or some sort. However, this was an inconvenience for me because I’m flying into Fort Lauderdale and now I’m going to be on the road extra late now do to the flight being delayed for an hour."
786,✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to Atlanta. The personnel on the flight is what really made this a great flight. I have never run into a better flight crew. Friendly without a false feeling. On the lookout for problems and a way to help. Paired with the reasonable cost of airfare made this a pleasant flight.
787,"✅ Trip Verified | Columbus to Fort Myers. New seating is terrible, I will never fly Southwest Airlines again. Plane was cramped. I could not even sit with my wife on our way to honeymoon. I would not recommend."
788,"Not Verified |  I flew from Houston to Columbus in August, and it was a pretty smooth flight. The cabin crew were very nice, so was everyone there. I would reccomend Southwest Airlines."
789,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Jose to Denver. Normally I like Southwest, but they sometimes force you to put both carry ons under your seat if neither is a roller bag. This is horrible. I have a bad knee and am not taking up unreasonable space in the overhead with a laptop bag and have a purse with things I need in the seat, and then save room to stretch out to avoid pain. They allow free checked bags and to punish me for not bringing on a huge roller is ridiculous - others can check or gate check a bag! I'm very angry. Maybe I should buy a roller just for my laptop so I don't have a back pack under my seat in addition to my purse."
790,"Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Columbus. The Male flight attendant had a favorite row. He spent half the flight standing and talking to them. By the time we got out drinks our ""snacks"" (fritos and baby cookies) were gone because he was so busy playing favorites. Very unprofessional when I spent over 1000 dollars flying with you guys this trip. Never again."
791,✅ Trip Verified | Salt Lake City to Charleston. I would give less than one star if I could. When paying to fly you expect to sit by your spouse not several rows behind. Maybe they should think about updating the seating arrangements
792,"✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Boston. I pride myself on packing a carry on bag whenever possible, as opposed to checking a bag. I find it infuriating the lack of communication between the flight crew and the gate attendant checking tickets. Overhead bin storage for carry on luggage was cut off towards the end of the “B” group. For those who do not understand who SW operates, you are not assigned a seat. Based on when you check-in, you are either in Group A, B or C (#1-60). My fiancé and I were B45 and B46 and around B35 an announcement was made that no more carry on bags allowed because overhead bin space was full. No big deal, right? Well when you walk down the aisle and see five bins completely open, I was inspired to write this review. (That doesn’t include the bins that were partially full). See below for just a few photos."
793,"Not Verified |  Reno to Phoenix via Las Vegas returning PHX-RNO, Outbound both flights were spot on with departure. Ground staff great in Reno. We were a pound or two over on our luggage, but no problem. All check-in staff very friendly. Even TSA was accommodating when I forgot to remove my IPad from my backpack and had to get rescanned. Reno airport is always great. Flight left on time. Typical snack/beverage service, with a smile from attendants. Onward flight all the same out of Vegas to Phoenix. Reasonable time for baggage pickup. Then out of the airport. Both flights on a 737-700, reasonable legroom and comfort. Return from PHX-RNO on 737-800. Newish plane but seats less comfortable then the 700. Staff still great and seem genuine. Early departure and arrived 20 minutes early. No complaints. Southwest always deliver a great product in and out of Reno. They have never let us down over the years. Also they had free WiFi and movies on the 800 plane. I did not use so can’t comment but saw others using it with no problems."
794,"✅ Trip Verified |  Denver to Spokane. A flight attendant did something I’ve never seen in more than 40 years of flying. As we were landing, she asked us all to give a round of applause for military on board. Inappropriate. Now lift up the Peace Corps. Teachers. Journalists. All who also do heroic work."
795,"Not Verified |  Indianapolis to New Orleans. I have been a big supporter of Southwest in the past. I would drive the 2 hours instead of using the local airport, because of cost savings and a good flight. I flew in March with no issues, but this September was a different story. My flight to MSY was okay, but the return trip was another story. My flight was cancelled. I did get another flight to a city that was two hours from my destination. I had to drive to the other airport to pick up my car. Southwest lost my luggage and i had to wait several days for it to be delivered to my home. I incurred extra cost to get back to the other airport at such a late hour, and lost money by not getting back home at designated time. I called Southwest to ask about reimbursement for at least my hotel and rental car that was extra, but was told we do not cover those expenses. I have another flight next month, and I decided to just fly from the smaller local airport. My expenses are a bit more, but my time has value as well, and with what happened last time, the flight was not cheaper in the end. Southwest did not provide value and I see no longer to fly with them."
796,Not Verified |  I used to love Southwest because of flight attendants being a pleasure that gave you peanuts. Last two flights to to get from Phoenix to Charleston staff had very poor attitudes to the point of being rude. To supposedly get a better seat we paid $50 for each of us (my wife and I) got a B position. 100 bucks wasted. Hopefully won't ever use them again. I used to write them compliment letters when Herb ran it.
797,"Not Verified |  Earlier this year we took a trip to New York and flew Southwest. On our return flight you cancelled the flight telling everyone there was lightning at LaGuardia and Southwest was not flying. You charged us $320 per ticket for a round trip. We should receive a 50% ($160) refund each for you not honoring your end of the contract. We received $115 each, curious as to what kind of math you used! No assistance of any kind was offered by your companies personal and we were told another flight wouldn't be available until the next day. The worst part is that it cost us an additional $900 to fly home to the wrong airport on Delta that day. We sat in the airport for nearly five hours waiting for our flight watching Southwest planes take off and land. Since this is the way you treat customers we will never again use your airline and urge others to do the same!"
798,Not Verified | Chicago to St. Louis. I flew Southwest and it was absolutely terrible. The crew was rude and grumpy. One kept yelling at me to push my bookbag under the seat and it was as far as it could go because they ran out of overhead carry on storage room so they had to check everyone’s rolling carry-ons as checked bags. It was a mess. I will never fly Southwest again.
799,Not Verified |  Salt Lake City to Cleveland . I just booked my flight through Southwest then booked a rental car through their same portal after that I booked by hotel. Saved me $53!  I thought I had done well for myself. They booked by rental car for an hour and 20 minutes after my landing but my hotel they booked for the next day. Since I continued and confirmed my reservation it is nonrefundable. This is all automated and does not indicate that my check in would be restricted till the next day. I went in again thinking I had just not paid attention and done something wrong.  It again tried to do the same thing. After 25 minutes with customer service did nothing but regurgitate the lines they had been taught (to admit to nothing and tell me I should have checked closer). When I told her I was their website trying the same thing again she wanted to hear none of it.  I will fly with them in the future but will not use their automated system to book anything else.
800,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Raleigh to Orlando return this past week on Boeing 737-700 aircraft. The inbound flight arrived 15 minutes early (and had 50 empty seats), while the outbound flight was full and on-time. Had no problems with the ground or plane crew in terms of service, the in-flight phone app entertainment worked fine, and it was an uneventful pair of flights. (Although it took 15-20 minutes for them to start unloading luggage at the claims area when I got back.) Getting TSA PreCheck helps immensely."
801,"Not Verified |  Philadelphia to Orlando. Delayed. Two hours. I can’t get home because it is a late flight and there is no ground transportation to my home. No compensation for hotel or travel. I will probably have to Uber for $130. They will not compensate for the shuttle service I cannot make it to because of the delay. The response of their ground crew “sucks for you”. Never again. Oh yes, the flight was delayed to get here also."
802,"✅ Trip Verified | St. Louis to Sacramento via Los Angeles with Southwest Airlines. The seats were annoyingly uncomfortable, but otherwise the flight was smooth. The “Evolve” interior in the 737-700 looks dated compared to the “Heart” interior found on the 737-800 and Max 8. The flight attendants were nice as well."
803,"Not Verified |  First time on Southwest Airlines from Salt Lake to San Diego and I’ll never ever book a flight again. When I travel with my wife I want to sit next to her, not some random strangers. I fly a lot but never will again with this company. Employees were rude and said things slightly offensive during announcements."
804,"Not Verified |  Orlando to Philadelphia. I was trying to get my elderly mother on a Southwest flight to Philadelphia so she would be safe from Hurricane Dorian which was headed towards Central Florida. Regulations did not allow me to help my mother get onto the airplane and into her seat. The Gate attendant was extremely helpful to me as my mother was traveling with her little dog and I was very concerned that she would become confused as she has some dementia and would not be able to find a seat or get into her seat while dealing with her dog and her purse. The Gate attendant made sure that someone assisted my mother onto the airplane and helped her get her dog safely under the seat in front of her. Once all the passengers were on board, he made a point of coming over to me and assuring me that my mother was doing fine on the airplane and that the flight attendants would watch over her on her 2.5 hour flight into Philadelphia. I cannot begin to express my gratitude for his helpfulness that day. He was an angel in disguise and I really appreciate everything he did for my mother and her dog. Many thanks."
805,✅ Trip Verified | We had to fly from Phoenix to LAX where we had a connecting flight from LAX to London from there. Our Southwest plane was 40 min late and we were running short on being able to make our connection flight in LA. Southwest announced that they were offering early boarding and early exiting for the late flight for $30 per person. We talked to Southwest employee about waiving that fee for us since the plane was late and jeopardized our connection flight. The employee said she couldn’t do that for us because we should have allowed more time for the connection flight. We had 3 hours. It seems that when Southwest is late it uses that to sell their customers early boarding and early exits because they know people with connecting flights are now running late and are forced to purchase these $30 extra tickets. What a scam! I showed up on time and waited for your plane that’s late due to you not being organized enough to get your customers in wheelchairs off the plane in a timely manner. Now you want me to pay extra for you being late? Horrible customer service!
806,"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Orlando via Nashville. On August 22 flight #2421 was over 20 minutes late arriving in Las Vegas. This caused the flight to leave Las Vegas over 50 minutes late this jeopardizing our connection flight #1296 in Nashville. The flight attendants then said they will hold the plane in Nashville until we arrive there. However, we paid for the early bird check-in because Southwest doesn't assign seats for their passengers. In order for you and your family members to sit together, you have to purchase the early bird check-in which assures you a place in line within the first 60 people. This does not work if your flight is delayed coming in and your connecting flight already boards everyone even the people who didn't pay for the early bird check-in. So you get screwed and lose your place in line which you paid for. So when they boarded us onto flight #1296 and we tell the flight attendant that we paid for the early bird check-in. The flight attendant says well we waited 20 minutes for your flight to get in. How is that the passenger's fault that the flight go in late? So they tell us to sit in the only available seats which are center seats not even in the same row. Also to make matters worse the seats are sandwiched in between 2 larger than normal-sized people. So I had to squeeze between 2 large people and my husband got to sit next to a 350lbs man who was partially in his seat so much so that he had to lay his tray table down to lean on it for the entire flight. Did the flight attendants care? Of course not because they herd people like cattle on these aeroplanes, they don't care if your flight is uncomfortable. The flight lasted 1 hour and 23 minutes to Orlando. When we got home. I called Southwest Customer Service and the only thing they said they can do from their end is to refund us the $12.50 each that we paid for the early bird check-in. They said to call their Customer Relations Department. On 8/30/19 I call Customer Relations and explain to the representative the situation and the terrible experience and she said she can only refund us $50 each in travel vouchers towards another Southwest flight. So this airline company takes your money, gives you a terrible flight experience and only gives you $50 each for your unsatisfactory experience due to their flights not keeping on schedule. I told the representative if Southwest assigned seats in the first place it would not have been a problem because no one would have sat in someone else's seat. We pay for the early bird boarding to get within the first 60 people on a plane so parties can sit together. Looking back in hindsight my husband and I should have walked off the plane and asked to be put on another plane where we would be able to board within the early bird boarding and not lose our place in line. I doubt if I will ever book another trip with Southwest."
807,"Not Verified | Columbus to Denver. I had a lot of anxiety about my trip. It was my first time taking my service dog on a plane. Every single staff member I encountered was friendly, professional and compassionate. Both flights and all 3 airports went smoothly. Truly appreciate the experience and will absolutely choose Southwest in the future. Thank you for getting us home safe and sound!"
808,Not Verified |  Original flight to Houston for first leg was canceled with no notice or explanation. Total trip was supposed to take 6 hours is now 14 hours. Rerouted to Dallas where most of passengers from Houston were on flight. I believe they cancelled the original flight to Houston to fill low passenger flight to Dallas. In Dallas now and have been shuffled around to multiple gates. 
809,"Not Verified |  Salt Lake City to Denver. I was checking in and the woman at the counter (Nancy) gave the absolute best customer service I’ve had with any airline! She helped me with my bags and was just overall, a really kind person. She should be the face of the airline!"
810,"✅ Trip Verified |  On both flights from New York to Los Angeles and the return, Southwest cancelled one leg of the flight leaving me to spend the night in the airport on my own twice now in one month. Today I had to wait a full 28 hours to board the next flight. Never book with Southwest if you are not flying non-stop to your destination. Cancellations and delays are the rule and not the exception. The airline does not provide meal taxi nor hotel vouchers. Delays and cancellations are always magically due to weather even in perfect summer conditions according to the airline. The truth is that the airline does not have enough planes staff and pilots to cover slight delays."
811,"✅ Trip Verified | On this day, our flight was delayed due to storms. I am a copd patient who travels with oxygen. After a long day of traveling, I was running low on battery charge. The flight attendants went over and beyond what I needed to make me feel comfortable. And charged my batteries. The outlets at the airport are far and few that even work. And the outlets are always far from were the wheelchairs are placed. After a 5 hour delay we made it home. Thank you for all your help and assistance. And to all who took time out of their day to help me, thank you."
812,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew Puerto Vallarta to Houston, pilot tried to land twice and was a bad storm, he good decided to come to Austin and get some gas. I am always some stress about airplanes and I have been handling pretty good, when I saw we were over the airport in Houston and had to go up twice I starting very nervous, the Captain explained the situation but was very stressful not your fault. I asked the stewardess if she can give me an alcohol drink and she answer in a bad attitude we cannot do that, I was so stressed. I understand sometimes you can’t but was the mean way she said, she was not nice with anybody please urgent put her in a customer service training; on the back of the airplane the other stewardess were serving sodas and taking care about customers she was only sitting at the time I asked for a drink. You have an excellent employees who always take care about customers and do amazing job but her attitude is the worst I have seen. "
813,✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Norfolk via Orlando. Yesterday I got on board my flight to ultimately take me to Norfolk. The weather in Chicago was lightning and thundering so the pilot wisely put us back at the gate after finding out that we would not be taking off for sometime. They allowed us to get off of the plane so that we could use regular washrooms. It soon became evident that I was going to miss my connecting flight in Orlando which would ultimately take me to Norfolk. I expressed my concerns with the pilot who suggested that I cancel and re-schedule for today. I went to the desk and got a ticket and will be flying out today. In the meantime I had many questions come up regarding my rewards program and had to call customer service for two different issues. Every single person I got with was perfect at handling their job. I cannot give a high enough rating for this airline. I have never had a bad experience traveling on Southwest.
814,"✅ Trip Verified | Milwaukee to Atlanta. My family and I were taking a vacation to St. Pete’s beach in Florida. Our flight from Milwaukee to Tampa Bay was at 6. We wanted to fly into Tampa and take a cab to the hotel where we would be staying. We could not fly directly to Tampa Bay so we had landed in Atlanta. Now that would’ve been fine if our two hour overlay didn’t turn into a 10 hour stay at the airport. We missed the first day at our hotel which we paid for. We had to sleep at the airport. And we could not meet the rest of our family who was meeting us down there. They flew on Delta. There was a storm in Tampa Bay at the time yet every single airline except Southwest was flying there. Delta and United were still flying to Tampa Bay. I am sad to say this is not the first time I have had an experience like this. At our 10 hour wait at the airport, the airline kept changing the estimation time from waiting to hours to adding an extra 8."
815,"Not Verified |  Dallas to Denver. The staff taking drinks to people was nice, but I watched him talk to co-workers while people are looking around at least twice. $300 each way so $600 is a waste if you don’t have beverages."
816,"✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to Milwaukee via Atlanta. Arriving to the airport from a business trip to be notified the flight was an hour delayed. Frustrating but understandable. Things can happen. A little over a hour later, received a text that the flight was canceled. Although it does text you new flights available, the process makes you pay for the new flight, so I didn’t process but went to the counter at the gate. There were over 50 people in a line dealing with the same situation. There were two ladies working the counter (there were additional stations open that more employees could have been deployed to move the line faster). I was in this line for 1 1/2 hours. Once it was my turn, no greeting from the employee, no apology and only one option was given for a new flight which was the following day with a layover making my direct flight into a much longer trip. I asked if Southwest was offering any compensation to their customers for hotel accommodations and the answer was “the weather in Milwaukee was going to get really bad and by the time the flight would get there, the airport would be closed, so no, they don’t compensate for weather”. That statement was false. I live in Milwaukee and no rain or storms were in the forecast. I left the counter not feeling valued as a customer. In customer service, how you handle a difficult situation is where you gain loyalty. Not one of those 50 customers walked away feeling valued or that anyone was doing all they could to help. I understand a regional airline like Southwest doesn’t have as many flights as the other airlines to try and help people, but they could have shown empathy, be apologetic, offered some type of compensation even if it was a voucher for their airline. But we were all just a number in a line. I will suggest to my company and to my husband’s company to think about this before booking their next flights."
817,✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Oakland. Always a pleasure simple easy and on time. No problems no questions. Simple and clear pricing. Why is united so all over the place? Always trying to make you feel like a class.
818,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Austin. I understand flight attendants have very minimal time to check through the plane before the next flight of people is being shoved on but I think after this flight that really needs to change. My 18 month old loves to pull out the magazine and info cards in the seat pockets and on this flight they were absolutely disgusting. One was sticky with who knows what, one pocket had so much trash fall on our stuff it was hard to tell how the magazine and info stuff fit, then there was a coloring book left right on the aisle seat that they easily could've picked up. Again I understand there's not a lot of time, but that should maybe be adjusted or get extra cleaners to come around, I don't know but it was a gross way to start the journey home."
819,Not Verified |  Really disappointed in the service I received. I have TSA precheck but it notoriously does not show up on my boarding pass when I check in through the app. I saw an attendant when I arrived at the airport and was told there was nothing they could do to make the TSA precheck show up on my boarding pass. I’ve been flying for 2 years with TSA precheck and have never had this issue with any other airline. Very frustrating for a frequent flyer.
820,"✅ Trip Verified |  Pittsburgh to San Diego via Chicago. Crew is rude, non caring. Probably the worst flight experience that I have had. Cabin of plane smells of mold/mildew. The boarding process is the worst. I will fly any other airline, but will not be using Southwest again due to how much i paid to be treated so rudely."
821,Not Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to Atlanta via Las Vegas. Most uncomfortable plane in existence. Plane appeared to be newer but the seats were so uncomfortable that my back took 4 days to correct itself. Could hardly move after a nice relaxing vacation. Put a huge damper on my week long cruise vacation. Would rather drive across the US then use this plane ever again.
822,"Not Verified |  After 25 + years I am giving up on this airline. The free bag perk isn't even worth it any more. We flew out of Reno, Chicago, Denver, Newark and Phoenix, all within the past 2 months, & every flight was badly delayed, this last time causing US to pay for a hotel even though our whole trip was with them. To add insult they gave us a place at the end of their line on the next days flight when we had places way up towards the front on the flight they caused us to miss. Not one bit of compensation offered and we watched them give some other people $600 vouchers to get bumped because they overbook their flights. You lose my business both with your airline and with your credit card after being a loyal customer all these years, thanks for treating me like worse than nothing."
823,"Not Verified |  Austin to San Diego. In February I flew with SWA from Denver to Austin. I arrived early at the airlines and was allowed to fly standby on an available flight. I explained this to the lady and she responded with, “we just don’t let random people on those seats, we would lose revenue” as she was holding my active duty military ID. Her supervisor then said, “you should have not bought such a restrictive ticket”. SWA has really diminished in the past years with customer service. Her attitude really was rude and unprofessional. Additionally if you do it at one airport you should do it at all or none."
824,"Not Verified |  Our family flew on a direct flight from San Antonio to Orlando. SouthWest lost our luggage and claimed that it never left San Antonio. Southwest also admitted that they do not track passengers luggage. Sounds like a serous security issue to me, our luggage has been floating around San Antonio airport for a month and a half but no one at southwest can find it. How is Southwest allowed to run an airline business without tracking passengers luggage? What are those tags for, you put on our luggage ? Dealing with customer service was horrible. Luggage claims experience has been similar : rude and useless. We thought southwest cared about their customers. Apparently not."
825,"Not Verified |  I am extremely disappointed with this airline. First time and last time for me. What a poor experience. I was supposed to fly from Orange County to Oakland. 1 hour 30 min before the flight, I got a text to tell me that my flight was cancelled. They booked me a flight the next day. The worst part:  My original flight was nonstop (1 hour 30 min flight). However, the new flight was with a lay over through Las Vegas (almost 6 hours), even though direct flights were available. I received no compensation for this significant inconvenience.  I had to call twice to get a flight from LAX to Oakland. In addition, I had to pay for an extra ride to a further airport and arrive very late at home. This was a poor experience with even worse customer service."
826,"✅ Trip Verified |  Reno to Phoenix.  I would say Southwest is unreliable in terms of timing, especially out of Reno. Sometimes they are on time, but I can say without hesitation, there are other airlines who are more reliable in terms of timing. Also Southwest aircraft are not the cleanest (food on floor, dirt between seats, etc). That said, they are cheap, flexible, easy changes, good bag allowance, good staff. But timing is not their thing."
827,"Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Long Beach. Terrible customer service, they assigned us the seats number, but when boarding, much to our surprise, some people already occupied our seats, when we requested to seat together they said we have to pay 30 dollars more per person, we are already paid close to 300 dollars for the one hour flight; Highway robbery in America! We definitely flying Jet Blue next time, because they have the ability to guarantee our seats and no surprises!"
828,"✅ Trip Verified |  Pittsburgh to Phoenix. I am not a fan of flying. However, I want to say how impressed I was with the flight staff on flight 1703 from Pitts to Phoenix. (July 23, 2019) They were super friendly, accomodating, humorous and in general, overall rock stars. As a contractor, I know how you never hear the good things; the focus is commonly on the negative. I am sure it is very much the same for them. They immediately apologized to many of us for the flight delay (only delayed 30 minutes). And instantly went into ""go mode"" to make us comfortable and less stressed. If you have some capacity of letting them know the service they gave was above and beyond, it would be greatly appreciated."
829,✅ Trip Verified | Baltimore to Lousiville. A belt for the luggage broke so we sat on our plane for over 1 1/2 hours. Very inconvenient when you were supposed to get home by 9 pm and had to get up at 6 am for work the next day!
830,Not Verified |  Portland to St. Louis. I haven't always been a Southwest fan but I wasn't able to make a recent flight due to unforeseen events. The customer service was outstanding! Very compassionate customer service and I will be a dedicated Southwest customer moving forward.
831,"Not Verified |  Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale. I have flown with this airline several times and have only come back for the low prices. The ground customer service is terrible. The people tell you different things, are often confused, and have a bad attitude. Both times i’ve flown southwest recently the plane has been overbooked and they also forced people with 2 carryons to check one, even though you are allowed to check two. The seats aren’t awful but they aren’t very comfortable either. Both time we have checked in practically right at the 24 hour mark when you are allowed to but we still end up in C class. It’s incredibly frustrating because I flew with my daughter who is 10. We were told there would be no problem getting us a seat together but when we got on not only were there no seats together but there was only middle seats left. She was really upset and scared to sit between two strangers. The pick your own seat just isn’t a good system in my opinion, it’s chaotic when you get on a plane, and stressful to find a seat. The on flight wifi is really low quality. The plane staff is fine but they in no way go out of their way to be helpful. I am overall very dissatisfied with my experience with Southwest and I will absolutely never fly with them again and unless you are a single flyer I urge you to choose a different airline too. The lower price is t worth the drop in quality. If you’re looking for a comfortable and low stress trip stay away from Southwest airlines"
832,Not Verified |  Indianapolis to Denver. I spent a lot of money on 6 tickets to fly to Denver for my brothers wedding. When we checked our bags in the lady at the counter told us we could board as family due to having 2 of my 4 kids under the age of 6. When it came time time board with family boarding the lady at the gate was trying to make my older boys ages 11 and 13 wait and board at the end with c class! She said only the parents and the children under the age of 6 could board as family. I spent more money on those tickets than probably anyone on that flight! I told the lady at the gate that I was told we could all board as family and she said no! For fear of being kicked off the flight I myself waited with my older boys and boarded last and we were all split up all over the plane and I couldn't get a seat close to my husband to help with the younger kids! 
833,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely ridiculous customer service. Don’t fly Southwest Airlines. Remember, you get what you pay for. If there are any issues that would require customer service assistance from this airline your done for. The nightmare initially begun on the 17th of July when I was scheduled to depart from St. Louis to arrive in Norfolk, VA. Arrive at the Southwest ticketing counter to learn my flight had been cancelled due to weather. Once I learned this, I asked the ticketing agent isn’t it protocol for someone to call, text, or email me the customer, to make them aware of the flight changes. The reply I got was priceless. Basically, my question was ignored. So, now the ticketing agent begins to look in order to rebook my flight. Now, they book me a flight for the very next morning. However, this time I will have to fly from St Louis to Cleveland, OH, then to Chicago, Illinois and then onto a Norfolk. Of course, I accept the reservation thinking all has been resolved and there would be no more issues. So approximately hours later I arrive back in St. Louis airport. I board the first flight from St. Louis thinking I’m finally on my way to my destination and I would be good to go. The plane lands arriving in Cleveland with the pilot coming on the speaker stating, “there’s a weather delay and no one can get in or out of Chicago”!  After sitting in Cleveland for almost four hours until finally being cleared for take off to continue the journey now to Chicago and then Norfolk. Finally, land in Chicago approximately three hours after my Southwest connection flight had already departed for Norfolk. I immediately go to Southwest customer service counter to explain what I just went through. First, I’m told all remaining flights are booked going to Norfolk. I’m also told that they can fly me to Baltimore, Maryland the next day, which would be the third day! And I’m also told when I get to Baltimore I would have to be on standby in order to try to get a flight to Norfolk. Now, my frustration is beginning to show. I ask if I would be provided a hotel here in Chicago and I was told no. So, I get no hotel, no later flight, and absolutely nothing at all in order to make up for this inconvenience. Not even a bag of peanuts or even a drink. I always knew this was a suspect airline. However, take it from me. Save your money and go United or Delta. If you don’t and something happens. In my case weather!!! Then, your just throwing your money away. I understand weather is not the airlines fault. However, it’s how the customer service takes care of their customers during that inconvenience is what is being measured. I’m a customer who definitely learns from their mistakes. In short, no one should have to experience this, especially in a strange unfamiliar city and then get told that the best they can do is have me sleep on the floor in the airport and then ride to another strange city to then be placed on standby for the final destination"
834,"Not Verified |  I am very disappointed in Southwest’s customer service. I booked a flight back in March and just discovered 2 days before my flight that they completely changed my itinerary without notification. I originally selected a 1pm flight out of Atlanta because I live 2 hours away from any airport and they are the closest. So, instead of waking up at 8am and leaving by 9 to make it to the airport at 11am. I now have to wake up at 4am to battle rush hour traffic and get 3 small children through the airport. There is reason I needed that flight time. Any later flights and I am looking at getting at my destination around 10pm-11pm and then Driving another 1.5 hours to get to my destination. When I called to see what could be done the corporate office pretty much told me it wasn’t their problem and there was nothing they could do. I asked if they could get my family a hotel room the night before, after spending thousands on tickets to book a flight you think they could throw me bone, but they said they would not and that again this wasn’t their problem. WOW. I always enjoyed flying with Southwest Because I though they were caring, but apparently this is no longer the case. I guess you get what you pay for."
835,"✅ Trip Verified |  Indianapolis to Chicago-Midway. Worst customer service. Flight was delayed due to maintenance issues. We were later boarded with them telling us the issue was fixed. We sat on the plan, didn’t take off. The Captain came in trying to be funny asked a stupid question about how old we all were. Then said we weren’t going because of rain in Chicago. I texted my daughter who lives in Chicago and was told it was total sunshine there. Then the same captain came back 30 minutes later to tell us the real problem was the original problem not weather. During our more than an hour of sitting on the tarmac while the  captain and maintenance crew were just trying to figure out why we couldn’t leave, we were offered nothing, no water, nothing! After another 30 minutes we were told the plane wouldn’t be going anywhere it was out of commission. This is almost 3 hours after we were supposed to leave. We were told to deplane and make other arrangements. I stood in a line of 6 people to get refund for an hour and a half. I was then told by extremely rude customer service people I’d have to call their customer relations department to get any compensation for sitting 5 hours in both the airport and on the plane. Horrible customer service! I called the customer relations number they gave me to find out they close at 4 pm EST and I’d have to call back tomorrow!! They could care less about helping people, just want your money. Southwest has gone down the tubes with regards to customer service."
836,Not Verified |  Atlanta to Las Vegas. I would never fly with this airline ever. First the flight pattern was changed. Just as we were getting ready to board the took our plane and sent it to Ft Lauderdale. Then we had to wait for them to locate us a plane. Now I paid for a direct flight. We had to first go to St Louis at which point we were not to change planes. We were taxiing in to unload those not going on with us and we were told to change planes. Then we had to go to Austin prior to Vegas. Now they only offered us food in a snack pack of mini pretzels (child size snack pack). While waiting in Austin to board additional people. The staff were begging no one to open window shades as the A/C was not working properly. It was over booked and very hot. 8 hrs later we land in Las Vegas starving and tired and hot. This airline could careless about our first experience with them
837,"❎ Not Verified | Great. All on time, highly recommend from Lubbock to Dallas. Nonstop, cheap efficient and great value for money. Open seating is not a problem, very comfortable seats and great customer service."
838,"❎ Not Verified | Dallas to Philadelphia. Never use Southwest. It is terrible. We had our flight cancelled 2 times because of technicalities. Our flight was supposed to be on the 11th so we went and our flight got delayed. We stayed there the whole day, then our flight got cancelled. Then we came back the 12th, and we now got a connecting flight from Dallas to Houston to Philadelphia. The one from Houston to Philadelphia got delayed for ""bad weather"", but when we checked, the weather was perfect. Then they were like, sorry we don't know if it will be cancelled or not. So we got another flight and we argued with them this time and on the 13th we finally got a single flight to Philadelphia from Dallas. And we were late to a very important camp all because of Southwest. "
839,"✅ Trip Verified |  Columbus to Las Vegas. I like their prices, but unfortunately, it was a very hectic and annoying flight both there and back. Arriving at the airport, we were told we would not be able to make our plane switch, due to the plane we were supposed to get on being delayed so much. So we had to re-schedule for the following morning and had to go clear back home and return to our flight in the morning. but we made it to Vegas. Then on the trip home, the flight was supposed to leave at 6:45 pm. We did not take off until almost 10 pm! We sat on the plane after boarding for over an hour. And then the flight was so bumpy and uncomfortable that I was in tears. It was just an all-around cruddy experience. Again, I love the prices that Southwest offers but for the experience we had, it should be even less. I just don’t think that I can ever fly Southwest again, unfortunately. They were apologetic about all of the delays, especially on the way back. But I still wonder how it could happen. It just seems unprofessional."
840,"✅ Trip Verified |  So dissatisfied with Southwest. My daughter was checked into her flight last night to fly out today. She received an alert that her flight was cancelled due to mechanical. No other options available no compensation provided. It was too late to cancel hotel and she ended up booking with Alaska and at such a late date, spent double what she will be refunded by Southwest. I will never again fly this airline. "
841,"✅ Trip Verified |  Charleston to Cleveland via Baltimore. After hearing great things about Southwest Airlines I booked a trip with higher expectations. The cost was reasonable and the fact that you could take two bags was awesome! It was my 4 month olds first time flying and I thought because the reviews were grand we would be just fine on this flight even though there was a connecting flight and layover on both round trip flights. I was very disappointed when we deplaned and were informed that our next flight would be delayed due to the air conditioning on the aircraft going out. What started out as a 30 minute delay became a 3 hour delay with a switch of aircraft. What’s worse? The aircraft we were switched to turned out to be having maintenance issues also. They took an hour to figure that out... then when we were called to board, we were turned around again because the plane had “too much fuel”. What was supposed to be an hour and a half layover turned into 5 hours with a starving 4 month old. I had a rental reservation that had to be pushed back twice, I missed my 95 year old grandmothers birthday party, and I ended up having to rent a car instead of the mini suv that I reserved due to the fact that the could not hold the car for me. This was by far the most uncomfortable and frustrating experience and there were no apologies or attempts at consolation from any of the employees at the airport or on the air craft. So disappointed in Southwest. Don’t fly with an infant you never know with this airline I guess."
842,"❎ Not Verified | Ft Lauderdale to Las Vegas. It was poor. We boarded the plane, they made us get off. They put us on another plane. Luggage on a different flight. Treated like cattle. The worst experience ever."
843,✅ Trip Verified |  I just wanted to say as a previous customer of another airline (which I care not to mention their name) I must say that this was my very first time flying Southwest and my experience was beyond exceptional I have never experienced such outstanding service from the entire staff including the Captain on my return flight. he offered to buy me coffee at Starbucks in Detroit and we talked and laughed along the way. No Airline has been that kind to me ever as Southwest has been on both of my flights!
844,✅ Trip Verified |  Baltimore to Boston. Awful the plane just arrived and they say that the AC is not working. So they said that we need to wait two hours for another plane to arrive. It’s only an hour long flight and it has turned in to a mess. The workers are being unhelpful and telling people to go talk to the people at the other gate (where no people are working).
845,"Not Verified |  Tampa to Kansas City. I know better than to choose Southwest, but somehow I did. The customer service was horrid. My 11 year old son was flying by himself. He checked no bags. The ticketing agent wouldn’t let me go with him over to the plane and help him make sure he knew where to go. She also wouldn’t let me use my KTN for him to go through TSA Pre, though when I travel with him on other airlines he gets to go through TSA Pre because I do. He’s too young and isn’t eligible for TSA Pre yet. The ticketing agent was rude and weirdly aggressive. I’m definitely never flying this joke of an airline again. If it were just me I’d have no issue, but to do this to an 11 year old is unconscionable. Especially when it was so busy and my son already was nervous and confused. I almost walked over to one of the better airlines and just purchased him a new plane ticket. You definitely get what you pay for with this sad excuse for an airline."
846,"Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Cancun via Chicago-Midway. After having a flawless flight to Cancun I was shocked at how things were so bad trying to get back to MSP. After leaving Cancun and told we were going to land in Chicago-we circled Chicago for over 20 min because of bad weather. Then told we were running low on fuel-we had to land in St. Louis to refuel. Then waiting on paperwork...we were finally ready to head back to Chicago. After landing in Chicago we were told we had to stay on the plane for an hour because we were not near customs. After 15 min we were able to get off the plane and get through customs and get our luggage. After all of that delay and when we got to a Southwest agent-he told us the next flight back to MSP would take us BACK to St. Louis and then to Ohio and end in MSP!  No Way! So the Southwest agent said, “If you think you can make your flight-go ahead and try!” So I booked it through security with many nice people letting me go ahead of them and starting at B1...I RAN to B26. Sweating and panting I made it to my gate with many “C” people still waiting to board. Hooray! (I was an “A” person.) I gave the ticketing agent my ticket and he called someone and said, “She has a ticket, but she is not coming up.” Then asked me to speak with a gate agent. WELL- MY SEAT HAD BEEN GIVEN AWAY SINCE NO ONE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE THE FLIGHT!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT??? With many people STILL waiting to board! Just unreal! They would do NOTHING for me but tell me I had a 9:50pm flight as my only option! Then they tell me I’m the last seat! A “C”-not an “A” like I was last time! Even though I asked if I could “please” get on earlier! No one was helpful at all-such a shame to leave our resort in Mexico where everyone was kind and helped in any way they could! Large disappointment to end a week of vacation! Really had a different view of Southwest Airlines after this return flight!"
847,"✅ Trip Verified |  Little Rock to Ontario via Phoenix. This was the worse flight of my life. There were 2 claim to be service animals on my flight. 1 of the dogs seem to really be a service animal because it was very chilled and quiet. The other was barking, jumping on people, the owner even let it loose on the plane doing the flight. Prior to boarding I witness this dog doing all of this, so when I was boarding it was hanging out into the middle of the isle, I asked the flight attendant if he could ask the owner to please hold the dog so I could board, I have extremely high anxiety and fear of dogs. He rudely said no, i'm not its a service dog. I said I understand but I have a disability also and I need to board. He rudely said, I am not going to tell another person how or what to do with their dog. A few people on the flight heard him and said Miss, let me help you and blocked the dog so I could get by. Shortly after plane took off, the dog was loose on the plane, a female flight attendant told the owner he would have to keep the dog with him.  I don't have a problem with people that need and/or require service animals, but I do think they should be made to control their animal. I paid almost $800 for my ticket was travel for bereavement of close family and then force to have to deal with my anxiety attack because of this one dog that was clearly not a service animal. This was the worse experience flying ever and I fly often."
848,"✅ Trip Verified |  Philadelphia to Memphis. Worst experience ever. Traveling with 3 children and 5 items of luggage. Our flight got weather delayed and missed our last connecting flight. No one on the plane or after exiting the plane was able to help. No one offered a hotel or even a ride with one adult three children, a car seat and four checked bags and a carry on for everyone. We ended up having to stay and even while in line with all these bags and children I was asking for help and all the employees said: “I can’t I’m monitoring lines.” Monitoring lines. Then after rechecking our bags, I got a call to find our new tags were not added. Which means they probably won’t end up at our final destination. I can’t wait for this day to be over just so I never have to fly Southwest again!"
849,Not Verified |  Oakland to Vancouver. Renee at Oakland airport service desk was amazing. She assisted me with a flight change to leave earlier than my scheduled departure. She also provided a complimentary drink ticket which I didn't realize! I really appreciate your assistance and wanted to thank you. Keep up the good work and thank you for everything you do.
850,"Not Verified |  I regretfully feel obligated to report my experience this previous weekend 6/22 regarding Southwest Airlines and their Southwest Vacations. I have been a loyal supporter of Southwest for over 15 years, and have had nothing but superior customer service and great experiences until this unfortunate event. I went to Southwest as I always do and decided to use their Southwest Vacations options since I was staying at a hotel this trip. Everything was fine, or so I thought, untill 6/22 my scheduled departure date. I go online to check in to my flight only to find out that my flight has been cancelled without notification to me. Surprised I call Southwest and try to understand what has happened. After about 2 hours on hold I was told that my flight was cancelled due to weather and that I had unknowingly booked through a 3rd party and not Southwest themselves, despite using the Southwest official website to book. After a 20 minute conversation I was forced to leave the following day as there were no flights remaining that day (unless I could get to the gate within 10 minutes), causing me to miss previously scheduled and paid for events that could not be made up or refunded. I then call the hotel and try to cancel my room since I will not be staying there and they said that since I booked though Southwest Vacations, they had to cancel the room and refund me. Did not seem like an issue. Fast forward to today, 6/27. I finally am back and get to speak with customer relations from Southwest. Thinking that this should not be much of an issue as they had miscommunication on their end, they could refund me for the nights stay that I would miss as they called and cancelled the night with the hotel, and would be able to compensate me in some manor for the error of not contacting me to allow me to get on a different flight earlier that day that had availability, and some possible compensation for the events that were missed. During the conversation with the agent for Southwest, she specifically said that ""They would take responibility"" for the error as Southwest Vacations is subcontracted though a 3rd party administrator. Even though it bears the offical Southwest logo, is accessed though their Official website, they contract out that to another party, but she still stated ""they would (were taking) take responsibility"" I think, great we can get this taken care of, to only have Southwest offer me a $50 voucher. $50 to cover 3 missed events, a premium room on Saturday night in Las Vegas, and a lost day of my vacation. This is 100% unacceptable as they themselves took responsibility for the error and still refused to at the very least refund me the money for the hotel room that was never used and some gesture for the error. I can not believe that Southwest who allows their logo and namesake to be used to mislead loyal customers into using something that they promote on their website, but then do not stand behind even though it holds their name is despicable. I felt disrespected as a loyal customer to be offered $50 for what was a loss of 20 times that amount. Southwest, if you are going to license out your name to a separate company, back them and have a system in place to contact clients, or do not promote them on your official website to defraud your loyal customers."
851,"✅ Trip Verified |  New Orleans to San Francisco via San Diego. Where do I begin? This is our first time flying Southwest since August of 2018 and to fully explain my frustration with their customer service I’ll have to start with the story of them cancelling both of our flights and leaving us with no other option than for us to pay 1.2k each for tickets back home in order to catch our out of country flight the next day. We are both wedding photographers and were leaving New Orleans to head to Baltimore for a wedding. The morning of our flight, about two hours prior, we received a notification from Southwest Airlines that our flight was cancelled. They provided us with alternative flight options, which we selected and then put us on standby (without communicating this with us). Fast forward, after a 10+ hour travel day we made it to Baltimore a little after midnight. Keep in mind the direct flight is normally 2.5 hours.  The morning of our returning flight from Baltimore to New Orleans we received yet another cancellation notification. However, this time the link to their flight change wasn’t working, no flights were available to select and the help call line to book another flight had a wait time of 2-3 hours. And so I waited, because we didn’t really have any other option. And each time they picked up the call they disconnected us, leaving us with literally zero alternative flight options or any way to get in touch with Southwest Airlines. This charade continued on until 4pm in the afternoon, no contact from southwest, no alternative flights, they straight up cancelled our flights and gave us nothing in return. Because we were leaving the country the next day we had no other choice than to pay 1.2k for a ticket out of Baltimore. Southwest Airlines finally got in touch with us a few days later, not acknowledging any lack in their system, pretending as though the day of our cancelled departure never happened. They offered us a $75 voucher for our trouble. What. A. Joke. Now a year later in hopes that southwest has their stuff together, we’ve boarded our plane from New Orleans only for them to tell us an engine failed to stay on. They asked us to switch planes, no biggie. This stuff happens. Two hours later and we’re finally boarding the next plane. We miss our connecting flight in San Diego due to their delay and end up waiting another two hours for our next flight. They call us to the front desk to adjust our tickets (A group, what’s up - yes, we were quick, we were prepared!) and they had us boarding at the back of the plane. I kid you not. They not only delayed us by 4+ hours but they didn’t even have the courtesy of taking care of us by allowing us to board in our original position, or even during pre-boarding. Come on southwest, we were loyal before you repeatedly screwed us over. So while, Southwest is great with their checked bags, and while it’s awesome that you can be flexible with them, remember there’s a massive chance they’ll cancel your flight and leave you having to spend a couple grand on a new flight and then pretend that never happened."
852,"✅ Trip Verified |  El Paso to Oklahoma via Dallas. What happened to all those employees who help in time of need? There were kids on the ground exhausted, people in distress by the boat load. You guys are so quick to tell good stories and how your employees help. They all went home to bed, the few that were there I could tell were bothered by the chaos and had no answers for anyone. There was one employee walking down the long line of people. I thought finally someone to help give us an update. No she was just trying to figure out why so many hundreds of people were in line at such a late hour. I guess if I didn’t start recruiting people at midnight to help find a taxi, UBER or Lyft to Oklahoma I would have slept on the floor and I think your staff would have left thinking that seems wild. It felt like we were treated just like that a wild animal who didn’t belong in the airport. Left @ 12:30pm from El Paso Texas Flight delayed while on plane 655pm due to fuel gauge?  The ramp got stuck and there was an electrical problem. Still stuck on the plane. Pilot in disbelief and apologies We wait back in the boarding area only to be told the flight is canceled, hundreds of people get in line. All the staff looked panicked with no words of comfort to a lot of sleepy, tired angry people. We wait for hours to be told no flights till Tuesday, no vouchers for hotel, no rental cars available, too late to rent by midnight. 1am looking for a place to sleep. Decide to start asking Uber and Lyft after 5 drivers refusing to drive that far. I tried to go back into airport and they wouldn’t let me in. I’m tired, stuck with a floor to sleep on. I call Southwest Airlines 1800 number lady tells me she can’t refund my money because I’m attached to my bags. I’m told by other customer after Storm was over many other flights took off. Yet we were canceled. I took lyft to drive us to Oklahoma city.  Now its 6.24 I need to figure out how to get my bags and rental car. what a nightmare I'm so upset with Southwest Airlines right now, they left me stranded, and for some reason decided our plane was canceled while others continued to leave to their destination."
853,"✅ Trip Verified |  New Orleans to Austin. Flight 2190 was delayed leaving New Orleans because of weather elsewhere but Janez at Gate 4B at Louis Armstrong Airport in New Orleans, La kept everyone in good spirits. She had the whole gate area engaged in a sing-a-long with incoming passengers; more than once inviting passersby to join in the fun. She went above and beyond her duty as a gate agent to insure that our day would not be ruined by a delayed schedule. Thanks to Janez and Southwest, frustrations were eased and smiles were plentiful!"
854,"✅ Trip Verified |  Oakland to Seattle. After being an hour late on mechanical issues, then loaded and taxing around then returned to the gate. Finally they bored a cop to escort off a passenger that ""wasn't listening to attendants"" along with his family. While doing it, the attendant joked about how cute folks thought the cop was. It was extremely poorly handled and now we are going to be 3 hours late. The keystone cops and attendants could not find their luggage. It was the worst flight I have had in the last 2 months and I have been on 5 business trips, so 10 flights. Now we have to gas up and get ok to leave again. Maybe we will never get there."
855,"✅ Trip Verified | Denver to Houston with Southwest Airlines. They cancelled the original flight, re-scheduled a new flight, delayed it three times. Too unreliable, I won’t fly them ever again, even if I have to pay more."
856,"Not Verified |  Flew Southwest back in June from Philadelphia to Kansas City via St. Louis and enjoyed the experience. Staff were amazing, flight was on time, and food and beverages were substantial for the short flights. My only minor gripe is that the seats could have been a little wider."
857,✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas to Houston. Horrible service. Boarding process is chaotic and unorganized. Sat on the plane for over an hour. No explanations given. Could have driven to Houston faster and with less hassle.
858,"Not Verified |  Richmond, VA to Houston, TX. Trip was planned with one stop in Atlanta, from there I would take another flight to Houston. The flight was canceled with no explanation given. Then they rebooked us to another flight that would leave 4 hours later. This meant we had to hang around for 4 hours in the airport. Then once it came for us to board see flight delayed for an hour, once again no explanation. Will never fly Southwest again."
859,✅ Trip Verified |  Burbank to San Jose. Overall pretty average. Staff was pretty good. Came with snacks and drinks. Inflight entertainment on app worked fine. Average selection of movies and TV shows. I think it had live TV too. Free messaging was pretty cool Slight departure delay SJC-SEA but we arrived just fine Legroom was pretty good-and I'm 6'2.
860,Not Verified |  The past two Sundays my flights have been delayed then canceled. Countless hours wasted sitting in the airport waiting on Southwest. Staff not very helpful. Low fares come at too high a cost. This airline is not dependable.
861,Flight from Tampa to Phoenix was rescheduled with no text message update. New flight was canceled an hour before flight after we got up at 3 am. Supervisor at Tampa airport was very rude when trying to reschedule flight for a third time. We lost an entire day of our vacation due to this and when I asked for priority boarding for our trouble I got a flat out “no”. No concern for the customer. Will never ever fly Southwest again.
862,"✅ Trip Verified |  Providence to Tampa. Not only did I spend over 10 hours on the Nashville airport floor sleeping on 6/9 because of flights and delays and no accommodations, I have now spent 7+ hours waiting at the providence airport on 6/13 Southwest Airlines where the staff here seem a little rude. I’ve been pushed to the side, delayed, and just have received poor customer service. My flights have been canceled twice now but have other flights flying from and to the same place through the same  weather that has canceled my own flight, interesting.  Now I have to arrange all my plans, spend more money, drive an hour to Orlando because the quickest way in was to Tampa, I missed work last week during that fight cancelation, I have to rent a car tonight, etc etc. It is just a little baffling there hasn’t been one employee to help accommodate completely ruining all of my plans and pushing me to the side when another customer decided his question was more important. I was told I’m getting two 50 dollar vouchers to southwest by a nice phone employee (the only one who seems somewhat reasonable) but I’ve been sitting here for 4 hours and haven’t received an email about that. Nice."
863,"Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Nashville. The tag on the bag came off from Las Vegas to Denver. I was called about the bag, in the terminal. Thankfully the man from Southwest called me and made sure the bag was put on the right plane. It was great customer service."
864,"✅ Trip Verified | On June 6 th my family was headed to my sisters wedding from El Paso TX to Island Park Idaho, where I was to be her bridesmaid. We landed in Salt Lake City. All of our luggage made it safely except one, the most important one. None of our clothes arrived. Being that we had a 4 hour drive we were not able to wait for it and later discovered it didn’t arrive until 9 pm or so. Staff member from baggage claim in Salt Lake did everything she possibly could to try and get me our luggage but fed ex wasn’t delivering over the weekend that far from Salt Lake. She told me to get clothes and necessities and Southwest would reimburse us. They did. She spoke with her manager and then called me back to see if someone could drive back and get the luggage they would give us a travel credit voucher. Unfortunately we could not but we still received a travel voucher. So we made the best of it. Upon return to Salt Lake airport the staff were wonderful, I gave them my receipts and they promptly wrote us a check to reimburse us for what we had spent on clothes. They retrieved our luggage. These unfortunate incidents do happen and although it does inconvenience one, it is not the end of the world. Thank you Southwest for making us feel better about our situation."
865,"✅ Trip Verified | I flew from Atlanta to Norfolk Virgina to go to Outer Banks, on June 3rd. Left on June 9th from Norfolk back to Atlanta. It was a rough day. Flights were canceled all over. After a very long day and many flight changes I made it home safe, but my bags were lost. I was exhausted and frustrated. I had made a very dumb mistake and had something in my baggage that was very expensive. I was sick, I went to claim office and filed lost baggage. Was told and filed loss. Was told my baggage would be returned next day. I received a call next day it was found and would be returned by 8pm that night. Sure enough it was. I am very happy to report all was in my bags, the item I was most concerned about was in bag along with all else. I don’t fly much but when I do it is usually Southwest. Have to say that will be my number one from now on. Most staff I dealt with were amazing. Have only one regret, the man who delivered to me was the nicest man and regret I did not get his name. Southwest, thank you so much for all you have done."
866,"Not Verified |  Baltimore to Palm Beach. I was very pleased with Southwest Airlines - I fly with them often and on 5/25/19 there were mechanical problems and the pilots timed out so we had to wait for a new crew. Southwest safely got us to west palm beach, although late, and then gave us a $75 Southwest Airlines voucher for our next flight. They managed the issues that were no fault of their own superbly. "
867,"✅ Trip Verified |  Milwaukee to Washington. Disgusting. Flight out of Milwaukee on June 9th was moved two times, by several hours and ended up being a red eye, because they forgot they needed a first officer for a scheduled flight. Agents at gate C23 in MKE said there are no other options and no compensation. And I could not be routed to another airline because they don't have a contract. Their supervisors were rude, gave me a phone number for a closed customer support, and when I told them I will tweet about my experience, one of the supervisors said he could care less, as Southwest PR department will take care of any negative comments. This is the third time Southwest has completely messed up my work this year without any follow up or customer service. Three of three trips. Southwest no more."
868,"Not Verified |  Montego bay to Cincinnati. The absolute worse service & guarantee the other 109 passengers on this 4x delayed now cancelled flight would agree. Horrible service would be a lie. This is horrendous in every sense. The staff has been lazy, not helpful & very slow getting basic information to the passengers. If if were only me this wouldn't bother me so much. Having my 6yr old son with me at 1031pm still waiting to here about tomorrow's flight & what hotel were staying in frustrating. Our original flight was suppose to leave at 355pm."
869,Not Verified |  I got no confirmation for my flight so I thought I must have forgotten to complete the reservation. 2 months later I realized I had been charged and after calling Southwest they said there had been a typo in my email address (.com was .cvm). They had my phone and could have reached out or someone could have noticed that I had misspelled .com and resent the email but they made no effort! The person I spoke to on the phone was rude and just said 'well you made the mistake'. I'm just out for the flight! Thanks Southwest!
870,"Not Verified |  We were flying out of Dallas to Rochester for a wedding, the flight was delayed & cancelled, we had a wedding to attend the next day, they put us on a flight flying to Buffalo Ny, I was forced to check in my carryon luggage, I had all my clothes, toiletries for the wedding. Our luggage was lost. We stayed in a hotel in Buffalo & paid for it. The baggage claim for lost luggage service was so rude. Southwest Airlines ruined our vacation. They overbook their flights. The service is terrible. If you are attending an important event or a short visit. I will not pick that airline."
871,"Not Verified |  Southwest Airlines is not an excellent option, because that system of free seats does not work. Groups of families traveling with minors within the ages of 10-15 can be separated from their parents by not finding a seat where they are together. I traveled from San Juan to Miami and back and my children at the ages of 13 and 16 were far from me and my husband."
872,"✅ Trip Verified |  Atlanta to Cleveland. My daughter is 12 and when I asked a Southwest representative If someone would check on my daughter or sit with my daughter to ensure of her safety while flying alone sitting next to complete strangers, I was advised my daughter was an adult and is on her on while flying. I was livid to hear at 12 no flight attendant would check on the safety of my child. If this is your policy the protocol needs to be change immediately for the safety of our children. I am uncomfortable sending my child on Southwest Airlines knowing that no Southwest employee is obligated to check on those minors flying unaccompanied!"
873,"Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Phoenix. We boarded 5 minutes early, departed on time, & landed on time. We got free drinks, free peanuts, & free pretzels. But I then flew on Southwest again from Phoenix to Little Rock & also had a amazing experience. Those were my first 2 times on Southwest."
874,"Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Sacramento via Denver. Worst flight and customer service experience ever experienced. I can understand that weather is out of their control but it’s how the flight changes were dealt with and poor customer service received that prompted this review. We were flying from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Sacramento on a Sunday over Memorial Day weekend. Unfortunately there was a layover in Denver and we missed the connecting flight. Automatically rebooked the flight to the following evening and they did not offer any accommodations. Also, because we were put on standby for the earliest flight the next day their system removed us from the confirmed flight the following day even though we were fifth in line for standby. They did not tell us this ahead of time and we slept in the airport because we would’ve paid $150 for 4 hrs of sleep since we would have to go thru security once more in the morning. When we did not make the cut for the following morning flight the later evening flight no longer had spots available. After two hours, and three service reps later we finally came across a service rep who cared enough to search for an earlier available flight to Sacramento. Abdenbi was so great and a blessing to our rough experience. Regardless I will never again voluntarily travel with southwest. They should have handled this better by making it right with anything (coupon voucher accommodation, etc.)"
875,"Not Verified |  Newark to Santa Ana. This was our first flight on Southwest Airlines. We had several delays because of weather and had to sit for hours. The staff was so courteous and helpful. Everyone was apologetic and tried to accommodate whenever possible. In Particular, our customer service rep out of Newark, Ramon went above and beyond to get us to our destination. He checked in with us often to make us feel more at ease right up til we boarded our plane. Kudos to him! It was great to see so many smiling faces from that airline. Thank you to all."
876,"✅ Trip Verified |  Oklahoma City to Las Vegas. This is the worst airline I have flown in my 61 years, never again. It was not cheap by any means, I traveled with my wife and 2 children, we couldn’t find any seats even close to each other’s, very disorganized, flight attendants rude, not welling to help. Never again"
877,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a flight from San Antonio to Colorado to Vegas for Thursday at 7:45pm we had a wedding to get too. Our flight got delayed so we wouldn’t be flying out till 11:30. We sat at the airport all night for a few hours and then They offered all of the passengers $100 vouchers. As we went to get our $100 vouchers they said our flight was canceled it would be too late for us to leave from Colorado to Vegas when it landed so they said they Can re book us. They rebooked us to fly out of San Antonio BUT they split us up and we all are having to arrive at separate times ranges from early morning to late afternoon. We lost a night of a hotel we had already paid for because the hotel wouldn’t let us save our night for another one. We missed the wedding we were going for and one of our friends was stuck without a hotel since we wouldn’t get there till the next day to check In for her since it was underneath one of our names. Very disappointed they did a horrible job in accommodating us for the horrible experience we had. The lady said it’s out of her hands and we can either re book or leave it alone. Southwest Airlines has done nothing to make us feel like we didn’t lose out on time, hotel money and food and our friend was left stranded alone in the Vegas airport for a whole night."
878,✅ Trip Verified |  We flew Southwest with a connection through Phoenix to San Antonio on March 20th. We boarded in Phoenix and weather in Texas caused a delay of over two hours. The staff was nothing but accommodating. Obviously they can't control the weather. Besides being polite and accommodating when we did finally get going they gave the entire plane a free drink service and then we woke up to find a 100.00 coupon in our emails for future travel. Southwest puts the ridiculous budget airlines to shame and will be our first choice whenever possible.
879,"✅ Trip Verified |  Austin to Phoenix. Our 7:15 a.m. flight was cancelled about an hour in advance, and the next available seats were the next day at 1:30 p.m. Southwest does not go the extra mile to help you reach your destination; they are not willing to work with other airlines, even when the responsibility for a canceled flight is on them. It’s unfortunate that the best  they could manage was a 30 hour delay. My husband and I were planning our anniversary trip for months, and due to Southwest’s operations, we essentially lost two days of travel. Will not be a repeat customer."
880,"Not Verified |  I thought I had left early enough to get to the airport on time, but I grossly underestimated how long things sometimes take for parking, checking bags, etc. My original flight was supposed to leave at 5:30, but I had just gotten started getting my bags checked at 5:15. It wouldn't let me verify my flight in their system, but within a minute or so the employee had asked if I wanted to be rebooked on another flight at 5:50 going to the same place. So very quickly I went from disaster to incredibly happy, and the rebooking was free of charge. I thanked him, and even still managed to get a good seat on the first flight. Very nice gesture that my late but very much appreciated!!!"
881,"Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Oakland. Never flown Southwest before this trip to the USA. Overall rating would be quite good, save for their seat policy. In Europe or Asia I've flown low cost airlines which, (sometimes for a small premium fee), allow you to choose your seat in advance. With Southwest you are only allowed to pay a, substantial, fee to be among the first to board, but with no guarantee about the seat. Should they allow seat reservation for a normal fee they would make a big improvement in what already is a good airline."

Dallas to Denver. Watched staff let all of A and B class take on more than one bag then forced people in other classes to stow all baggage regardless of their willingness. The agent was very disappointing in her response to why my single bag had to be checked while other were allowed to bring two or even three bags. She simply lied and said that didn’t happen them started saying sir over and over in a condescending manner. I finally just walked on the plane no ticket for my bag no idea if I’ll ever see it again. Why can’t I have a ticket for my single bag that I paid to bring on to the plane? Extremely condescending employee. Very unhappy customer."
883,"Not Verified |  Good afternoon. I wanted to take a minute to say thank you and share with you why you have converted me from another airline for life. My wife’s Grandmother was in her last days and hours of her life, the last week of March this year. My wife and I had planned on traveling to see her and had a ticket purchased already for my wife and one of my daughters, but we needed it changed and needed to get me and my other daughter a flight. For my work, I travel quite frequently from Nashville to Dallas among other places on another airline. Because of my status I like them to continue to build points with them. I called them first to book myself and my daughter a flight to Phoenix. They were of no assistance, would not budge on the price for an emergency, and would still charge me a large amount to move my points. I hung up. My wife then called Southwest. Not only did they get us booked last minute, they adjusted the pricing for an emergency, and helped us the whole way thru it moving our points around etc.. Even when we got to the airport, they bumped us to an even earlier flight to get us there as quickly as possible. What a blessing it was to fly with you. If we would have gone with the other airline, or had we not been bumped up to an earlier flight, we would not have made it in time to see her grandmother before she passed. We arrived within less than 2 hours of her passing. What you do for people every day may seem routine, but for us, it was a life changing moment. Having my wife be there before her grandmother passed means more to me than I can possibly express to you. As a result, I have decided to switch to Southwest for all of my work and personal trips going forward even though I do not have status with you. Sometimes I fly out of Knoxville where you do not service, but other than that, I will forever use you now. Thank you for making such a hard time for my family, just a little easier."
884,Not Verified |  Raleigh Durham to Austin via St Louis. My flight was scheduled for 8:00 pm departure. It was delayed waiting for passenger on a flight from Orlando. It looked like I might miss the connection in St. Louis. I checked at the service desk in Raleigh. They called and assured me that the plane would wait in St. Louis. I get to St Louis and I get off the plane and the flight to Austin is delayed 2 hours. I will arrive at 2:00 AM. I use lyft and I doubt that they will running at that time and I live 40 minutes from the airport. They couldn’t offer me a room in St Louis or any alternative. I really feel they are not telling me the truth. I have lost trust in Southwest. They are no longer my preferred airline.
885,"Not Verified | Nashville to St. Louis. After a two month wait and being promised by a customer care rep that my rapid rewards points would be restored (since I had account activity in the last 24 months) within 10-14 days, I found out (after being on hold for almost 2 hours total) that my request was elevated and denied by the administrative division at SWA. I will grease my butt and slide to my destination before I ever fly Southwest again! I don't know why they call it ""customer care"" because I can assure you Southwest could care less about their customers!"
886,"✅ Trip Verified |  What should have been a six-hour flight was changed to a 12-hour flight with 3 layovers. Pretty annoying. We left Philly, got to Dallas Lovefield airport and sat there for 1.5 hours. Then a flight to Albuquerque. Then to Las Vegas. Finally back to Spokane after that. We begged multiple times over multiple phone calls and emails to have our flight changed back or at least a voucher. So far, nothing but a ""sorry"". What a miserable service."
887,"✅ Trip Verified | Los Angeles to Oakland. A worst airline you can imagine. They do not assign seat numbers, overbooked the flight, no place for baggage. I will not recommend Southwest Airlines to anyone. Yes their prices are low because their level is low."
888,"Not Verified |  My handicapped sister and I were to fly from BNA to LAX via Atlanta. Several passengers experienced a St Louis flight cancellation. We all sat on the plane until they figured out how to help them. In the meantime several more of us missed our connections as we sat on the aircraft. Those of us who missed our connection to LAX were sent first to New Orleans then to Austin, then to Phoenix arriving much later than our scheduled flight arrival time. We were exhausted, couldn't get off the plane to get something to eat. Having arrived many hours later than scheduled, we missed our prepaid shuttle at LAX that would have taken us to Ventura, not exactly an inexpensive cab ride home. I have been looking for the card given to me by the lady who helped us at the baggage claim area of customer service for Southwest. She found us a room because we were stranded. I'm very grateful to her for helping us. Its hard to believe Southwest put us in this position and made such a miserable trip of it."
889,Not Verified |  Orlando to Saint Louis. We only got 3 of the 4 bags we checked on a direct flight. The employees are clueless and lazy. The little bag of pretzels and quarter can of Sprite to wash it down with is insufficient. All around just a terrible airline and lousy experience.
890,"✅ Trip Verified | I took a returning flight from SJO to FLL yesterday with my 68yr old father who has Parkinson's. When I got off the plane there was no assistance. It was a complete disaster trying to get through baggage, declorations, and customs. I booked my flight to SJO with Spirit Air, who clearly at booking gives option for Wheelchair Assistance. Everything on the Spirit flight went smoothly. Not the case at all with Southwest. It couldn't have gone any worse. When I contacted Southwest customer service, I was completely dismissed and was told it was the airports problem. I was also told I should have not used the app and booked online so I could drop down a box some place and choose Wheelchair assistance. Doesn't sound so handicap friendly. Regardless I arrived at the airport 3 hours before my flight so I could get this handled and was left on my own with my father who can walk far with consistent tremors and dementia. Customer service could not careless."

Austin to Houston. This trip which ended in Alabama was the most horrible experience I’ve had in all the years of traveling first the company that I went to work for chose the least expensive way to get me to the location. When I boarded the plane I was wearing a leather jacket that was owned by my stepfather who had passed away it was handed down to me for years. I had admired this jacket and I decided to take it with me for good luck at my sales event however it was rather bulky so when I got on the plane they were full and the airline stewardess asked if I would put the jacket in the above head storage. I’ve heard horror stories of arguing with a flight attendant and have seen too many movies so I complied and put it in the overhead bin. However I did not realize of the seating arrangements which is open seating when you get on the plane so the only seats that were available were the center seats which left me at a disadvantage where I couldn’t see the overhead bin that my jacket was it So when we landed I had to wait for everyone to move in order to get out of my seat and by the time I got to the bin where my jacket was to be it was gone I of course did not get upset because again did not want to be escorted off the plane so I asked as I got off about my jacket they said they would check on it once I get off. I waited about 15 minutes or so no one came out finally someone came out and said they could not find my jacket and that I would have to report it online because they had no one there to take the report which I thought was odd as a customer service gesture. When I finally spoke to them they told me that I need to report it online, after I done so all I heard from them is we haven’t found it we haven’t found it to this day. I have not heard from them again it’s as if they don’t care what happens to your belongings and they have no sense of responsibility how sad for the general public"
892,✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas to Chicago. I love southwest. The airport is near downtown. Flight are on time. Free wifi for messaging and movies with southwest app. Two bags allowed to check in and no cancellation fee. American has 200$ rebooking fees for any airline credit u get. Staff is happy and want to help.
893,"✅ Trip Verified |  Probably would not have been a bad experience if timing wasn't important but we had a connecting flight to meet up with a group of travelers to experience the adventure that most only hope to live. You look over the the rude comments and answers to your questions while checking in and think well I guess “you get what you pay for”. But when the flight was delayed, delayed, delayed and finally canceled. We start scrambling to make the connection only to be told I apologize sir all flights are booked (while looking through those glazed over eyes of I really don’t care sir please step aside so I can brush off the man behind you) we can put you on a flight tomorrow and there’s nothing more we can do. But our connecting flight with the group departs tonight. Again expression doesn’t change “I apologize”. I’m sure she was only caring out the script she had previously rehearsed in a training send down from corporate. Well we missed our connecting flight and because of the logistics will miss the first two days of the journey. I feel bad I was difficult today, I guess you get what you pay for. I assure you this airline will never have to apologize to me again"
894,"Not Verified |  Indianapolis to San Diego with Southwest Airlines. Terrible customer service. Changed my flight from a non-stop to 1 stop. Ruined my one vacation that I get every year. Horrible ""customer relations"" wouldn't let me speak to anyone apart from a staff member =who kept repeating that there was nothing they could do."
895,"Not Verified |  Austin to Phoenix. Southwest had cancelled our returning flight and moved us to an earlier flight and were never notified us of the change. When we showed up at the airport they told us we missed our flight. The ""supervisor"" basically told us it was our fault because the only thing we had to show him was our original booking document. He said, ""Oh that document is from February, so it doesn't count"", but he never even claimed that we had been notified of the change. We ended up wasting an extra eight hours at the airport. Southwest has screwed up three of the last five trips we have taken with them. Their customer service has taken a sharp turn for the worse."
896,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Phoenix. Don't check bags on this airline!! Worst service ever. Injured back and needed to check all my bags to avoid carry on. Checked two bags. When i arrived in Phoenix one bag was delivered to the baggage claim area the other was not. Of course its my bag that includes laptop, along with keys to my truck, keys to my shop and many important documents. When i asked the southwest rep where my bag was she told me to wait and see if it shows up on the next flight. Its 9am here and the next plane lands at 2:40pm. The rep could not track my bag or find its location. I can't even file a claim on the bag until after 3pm today. This airline is a joke. You get what you pay for i guess. I will never fly Southwest again."
897,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our family of 10 booked tickets to the Dominican Republic, and they cancelled the flight going home. They have another flight the following day, and they said there is nothing they can do. It will cost us $1,200 to stay in a hotel near the airport for another day. The top tier customer service line said they cannot offer vouchers and almost directly said they don't care. They've offered vouchers to offset costs for hour-long delays before at airports (I've seen it), but they strand people in a foreign country for an additional 24 hours and don't care? We waited 2 years for this vacation and use Southwest exclusively to build up points. We will be cancelling our Southwest credit card and switching to American for all points and flights. Unacceptable. "
898,"Not Verified | Atlanta to Houston. Southwest is the best thing to ever happen to airfare. On time, affordable, and accommodating. But above all, their Rapid Rewards program is the best. Easy to earn free flights, and easy to redeem / book for free. We've been flying them for a decade and will never fly anyone else."
899,"Not Verified |  On August 28th, 2018 my family and I were flying back from what was suppose to be an amazing vacation. Unfortunately and unexpectedly, we lost my father while we were on vacation and he was with us. As we boarded our flight, one of the flight attendants recognized us from our departure, and asked if we were down a family member.. We said yes and told our tragic story. After learning of our unfortunate circumstances, Gisela was the most amazing, caring, thoughtful person ever to step into our lives at the very moment we needed her! Offering to help with loose ends and comfort. She was absolutely an angel! Thank you so much Gisela."
900,"Not Verified |  I enjoy that the flight attendants bring snacks and drinks around multiple times during my flight from Saint Louis, MO to Sacramento, CA. The flight attendants are welcoming and pleasant. I recently started ordering WIFI. I have ordered WIFI 3 times. 2 times out of 3 the wifi connection is awful and end up not being able to use the wifi I pay for. So I will never pay to use this wifi again. It does not work well. Waste of money. Besides my one complaint l have liked Southwest overall and will continue flying with them."
901,"Not Verified | Las Vegas to Baltimore via Chicago. Never never again. Our first flight was supposed to be to Midway/Chicago then on to BWI but it was cancelled due to weather. Understandable, not a huge issue. We were given a direct flight to BWI which left Vegas 9 hours later then they rerouted us to Norfolk, left us here for 5 hours then just delayed us another 2 hours!! I have no idea where or luggage is or will be and nobody seems to know or care. Never again will I travel with Southeast and I will make sure nobody I know does either."
902,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience with Southwest. They cancelled my 6am flight from New Orleans to Omaha without notifying me. I checked out of my hotel room and got to the airport at 4:15 in the morning to discover my flight had been cancelled. I waited in line for 3 hours to find out the didn’t have a flight until the next morning. I had to book another flight with American Airlines in order to get back home. On top of the terrible service and having to spend 16 hours in an airport, I emailed the airline to see what they could do for me and they refused to do anything for my inconvenience. I will never fly southwest again."
903,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest is supposed to be a good airline? That’s an urban myth. They cancelled my direct flight from Vegas to Orlando without apology or explanation, and offered nothing for me losing an entire day after having to rebook a connecting flight later in the day. They wouldn’t even provide me an earlier cattle call position. Not flying Southwest again."
904,"Not Verified |  Recently my friend and I flew from Kansas City to San Juan, transferring through Baltimore. Coming back we left San Juan to Kansas City, transferring through Tampa. My friend had shoulder surgery less than three months ago, and was still handicapped. She had called ahead of time, as she is not able to walk very far, and the airline (when ask) always had a wheelchair and person to put her on the plane, or take her off, which really helped me, as I was carrying our overhead bags. Since she has long legs, one of the flights she had to sit about 3 rows back, with the seat next to the isle. The bad part of this was that she could not stretch her legs, like if she was on the front row, and the arm rest would not lift up, for her to push herself out. The other 3 flights she was able to sit in front, and the only thing she missed was the tray on the ""newer"" flights that helps hold the snack and drink, where the older air planes do not have this. All the airline personnel, no matter who they were were always helpful on these 4 flights. I am used to using a Kiosk in Kansas City outside, and San Juan only has one inside, and that made it hard, trying to drag all the luggage inside."
905,"Not Verified |  St. Louis to Las Vegas. Booked earliest flight 5.30am depart to 7 am arrival to make it to a brunch and even paid extra night at resort to check in before 3. Received email flight cancelled and rebooked automatically 10.30am to 1.30pm - no phone call for other flight options?! Called representative to ask for earlier flight for both of us .. after 30 minutes was able to make the changes for both of us, I thought. Received an email next day saying I missed my flight and was considered ""a no show"". The phone representative booked the wrong date for 1 of our tickets! I called to complain to representative and they were unable to refund my ticket! I had to purchase a new ticket on my credit card. He referred me to another customer service line, waited 50 minutes on hold before being assisted. Then I was told they would ""try"" to refund me when it was clearly the employees fault! After arguing my case politely and being on additional holds, I was told I would be refunded within 30 days. So my credit card remains double charged for 30 days?  3 hours on the phone and 4 people later on the phone and still waiting for my refun. I have been a loyal Southwest Customer and even referred friends for the Rewards Card; however, this was the worst experience I've encountered. Extremely disappointed. You think they would at least give some sort of voucher for such a bad experience. I had to argue to not have to double pay security fees and tickets."
906,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is actually for a flight I will catch tomorrow. Southwest was so unbelievably nice to me just now that I had to do something nice for them. Think about that for a second. A large corporation was so good to me that I searched for a way to show a little gratitude? This is a first for me. I am so used to ATT nickel and diming me every chance they can, and my bank finding new ways to pull more fees out for any slip up on my part, that I thought my money was gone when I realized that I forgot to change my flight to tomorrow. Their policy is that you can change or cancel and get a refund on any flight as long as you do this before your flight takes off. That policy, 2 me, makes SWA the best. Buses and movie houses won't give you a thing if your plans change and they would only be giving you a few dollars. Well this time I forgot to change the flight and thought that they are already being so generous to let customers change their minds for free there is no way they would help me out after I failed to simply do my part. I called and my flight is tomorrow. No charge. Any other airline would have cost another $180. Southwest, you had every right to charge me again, but you didn't. I owe you one. "
907,"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to the terrible storms that recently took place in Dallas, Texas, I was unable to travel to California for two days. The flights the following days, of course, were full since everyone had rescheduled, and I had to cancel my trip. I was traveling on American Airlines to California first, and then Southwest from Burbank to San Jose Airport. Because I could not get to California in time to catch my Southwest Flight, I had to cancel it. It was canceled two days before I was to leave (April 7 canceled). I then received an email at the time the flight was supposed to take off in Burbank that said I had not canceled the flight and that I would lose all my money because I had not canceled it before the time of departure. The huge storms in Dallas were not my fault, and Southwest should have at least credited my account for a future flight. Nearly all other airlines do this. They refused to do this. I won't be flying them anymore. There service has become increasingly worse during recent years, and there pricing policies (e.g., the business seats scam we all know about) are byzantine."
908,"✅ Trip Verified | Grand Rapids to Las Vegas. Very disappointed. First, they cancelled my flight 3 days before leaving. They informed me by automated call that it was cancelled but, I could have my money back. No offer of alternate flights, nothing and, I went through a travel agent! They hung up when we tried to book other flights. Offered nothing in return of losing most of a vacation day. Then, coming home more delays and a “sorry” over the speaker at the airport. How about a ticket, discount, drinks, premium seating? Nothing. Southwest needs to work on customer service!"
909,"✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Dallas. The issue I have with this airline and the flight experience I had stems from the general lack of communication. Flight planned to leave at 8:04 pm from Atlanta with expected time of arrival to Dallas at 12:35 pm (the plane was to stop briefly in Austin with no projected plan to switch planes). We arrive to Austin and hear over the intercom while in the plane, “This flight will be heading to Chicago so if you are going to Dallas you will have to get off this plane to meet with another plane expected to arrive soon. Sorry for the abrupt change, guys.” Essentially, I was booted off this plane with no email/text update from the airlines. As I get off the plane, everyone from my flight who had plans to fly to Dallas were all confused and lost because no one knew where to go to next/what gate will be the next plane leaving to Dallas - nothing! I have never had service like this with them but I believe today they completely dropped the ball! I wish I had some sort of email/text correspondence that would have alerted me of this change. The original flight had no delays foreseen or anything officially stated to those on the flight. It’s completely inconsiderate to those who need to return for work or need to be home to their children for school the following day when abrupt changes as this with little time to make room for adjustments. Ridiculous!"
910,"✅ Trip Verified |  My fight was 1193 from Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale on March 27, 2019. This was by far the best flight I've had with any airline. The flight staff was very courteous and humorous. They constantly made announcements keeping us informed of everything. Treated us like family and kept us laughing and entertained. The flight was smooth and on time."
911,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas to Atlanta. Received a text at 12:30 pm informing me that my 2:30 flight was delayed until 5:00 pm. Fine, not a problem. Then, on my way to the airport at 2:30 pm and received another text stating that my flight was now leaving at 3:00 pm. Arrived to the airport to learn that those times are only considered “estimates” and that I should’ve been here at 12:30 in case that changed. Nowhere in my communications from Southwest was I informed of this. Got rebooked for a 9:30 pm flight and since I’m now here 6 hours early I can’t even enter the gate areas. Also this trip was originally to take place a week ago but had to be rescheduled because Southwest cancelled that flight. And this the 2nd time in a row that I have had this flight cancelled. And Dallas is a Southwest hub. I will never use this airline again. Buyer beware."
912,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Oakland. Southwest cancelled our flight going and coming home. Instead of trying to help their customers they just leave them without options. Within minutes every flight was sold out. When they cancelled our flight flying out, I called and the customer service rep said my flight coming home would not be cancelled. It was and I was not able to get another flight for two days which was not possible due to a connecting flight. We had to go with another airline that could accommodate us. It cost allot of extra money and time. Southwest could have cared less. Then when I had to cancel the flight I booked two days later after I asked if I would get a full refund if I could get another flight, they tried to charge me anyway. It is unbelievable the lack of customer service they have provided this trip. I’m not understanding why they couldn’t just get another plane to put all of these customers on and leave them where they are rather than just leave them with nothing to fin for themselves. As of now I am considering never flying with them again and cutting my southwest card up. They never once tried to make the situation better. It’s really sad they are treating their loyal customers this way. You need a better system Southwest when you cancel flights. For me personally, I’m scared to ever book a flight with you again. I was really worried about how my family and I were going to get home at the LAST MINUTE."
913,"Not Verified |  Tampa to Kansas City. Southwest service is gone. 5 of last 6 flights wifi not working or intermittent. Have gone from economical with great service to mid range pricing with horrible service. So tragically sad! They're now the Greyhound bus in the sky. Filthy, out of date, sketchy planes."
914,✅ Trip Verified |  Indianapolis to Las Vegas. Very poor reliability. Flights on this airline are delayed in at least half my flights. It used to be reliable and now it is expensive and unreliable. The in air Wi-Fi is the worst I have ever experienced.  I will not fly Southwest Airlines anymore.
915,"✅ Trip Verified |  Raising the early bird to $20/one way p/person ($80 r/t) just put Southwest Airlines in the same category with other airlines that charge for bags, peanuts, oxygen, etc. Therefore my travel search will now include those carriers. Just cant leave well enough alone, can you. Just like all the rest, you always have to have more more more."
916,"Not Verified |  We were notified today that our flight home this Saturday to Chicago was cancelled. I called to get another flight home on Saturday and they were all booked as well as the Sunday’s flight! The only other option was to fly home on Friday, a day early, cutting time off our vacation sucks,, on a 6 hour  flight to Chicago getting us home at 9 pm! Then we still have a 3 hour drive home. We are prepaid for our one bedroom condo at the Hilton Grand in Vegas through Saturday so we are out $300 because we have to fly home a day early! I will be spreading the word about this experience as well as my husband! "
917,✅ Trip Verified |  I recently flew on Southwest airlines and the flight was delayed by a little more than 3 hours. Despite this being inconvenient it is sometimes unavoidable. Southwest airlines offered vouchers to all passengers for the inconvenience. The flight crew was also very apologetic for the delayed and the service was extraordinary. I have experienced delays in many other carriers and never compensated in anyway. I will fly Southwest airlines whenever possible in the future.
918,✅ Trip Verified |  Charleston to Midway. Flight was delayed about 5 hours. For everyone’s safety the flight was delayed due to mechanical issue. We were given a “Luv voucher” for more than the cost of the flight. All Southwest staff were very professional and courteous. Thank you to Southwest Airlines.
919,"Not Verified |  Denver to Tampa via Atlanta. Southwest has terrible customer service with a poor management of aircraft. They cancel flights routinely with the excuse “inclement weather” and then are unable to rebook you in a timely manner. Mind you other airlines and even other southwest aircraft are departing on time. It’s all good on Southwest if you flight actually leaves, but once your flight is cancelled, good luck trying to get another flight with the next 5 days. You might save on the ticket but in the long run you are out thousands because they have limited ability to accommodate one small problem in flight operations. This has now happened to me twice in a row. Other airlines do a better job of rescheduling you. Southwest leaves you stranded and doesn’t help with the expense of waiting multiple days to get back home."

I just wanted to share my recent experience with Southwest so that people can make informed decisions and know what they are getting themselves into when they book with them. I did not have a good experience with Southwest Airlines. I received an email from Southwest on Wednesday night indicating that my Thursday morning flight back from Boston to Denver had been cancelled due to weather. I had heard from my brother-in-law, who used to fly Southwest frequently, that they had a very strict weather cancellation policy, so out of curiosity, I went to check if all flights into Denver were cancelled, or if Southwest was just falling back on their strict weather cancellation policy. I found that both JetBlue and Spirit flights were still scheduled to arrive in Denver on time, which would lead me to believe that although Denver airport conditions may not have been ideal, they were safe enough for commercial airlines to fly in. Denver International Airport was even indicating that they had 4 of their 6 runways open. I called the number Southwest included in their flight cancellation email to reschedule my flight. After waiting on hold for about 1.5 hours, I was disconnected, so I called them back immediately only to wait on hold for 2 more hours. Once I was finally able to get through to a customer service representative to reschedule my flight, the representative told me that the absolute soonest flight they could get me on was not until Sunday, 4 days later. My husband and I had plans to go up to the mountains for the weekend and flying back into Denver on Sunday would have caused us to miss our entire trip. So I called AMEX Travel, as I had booked through them initially, and they were able to get me on a United flight leaving Saturday…one day earlier than the Southwest flight. At this point I was really wishing I would have booked with JetBlue or Spirit, as now I would be stuck in Boston an additional 3 days that I had not planned for. This means 3 more nights in a hotel, 3 more days of having to purchase food, and 3 more days of missing work. If this wasn’t inconvenient enough, my husband and I were also not going to be able to make our trip to the mountains, which we had already planned. Just for fun, I added up all the costs that stemmed from Southwest cancelling my flight. Hotel: $150/per night x 3 nights = $450 (prices had gone up over the weekend due to the St. Patrick’s Day holiday) Food: about $10/meal x 9 meals = $90 Missed days of work: $22/hr x 24 hrs (3 8 hr workdays) = $528. Total amount lost due to Southwest cancelling my flight because of their “strict weather policy” = $1,068 (this is not including the money that was already spent on our trip to the mountains that we were not able to take). I don’t know many people who can afford to just lose out on that amount of money. Southwest did end up refunding my cancelled flight, which naturally they should, considering they cancelled it. In addition, when I called in to see if they could offer any other kind of compensation, they offered me a $150 Southwest flight voucher. They indicated that because the flight was cancelled due to weather, the cancellation was out of their control and is not their fault. I beg to differ. JetBlue and Spirit did not cancel their flights, so clearly, the cancellation was due to some policy Southwest has that JetBlue and Spirit do not.,"
921,"✅ Trip Verified | I flew to MO from NY for my sons Army graduation. We had booked a return flight from MO to NY on 3/15/19 at 8:15 which was delayed until 10:00 then cancelled. I was told it was due to the weather and I would not receive a refund. After speaking to 3 different people I was finally told our flight was cancelled due to safety issues. My family and I had to purchase different tickets through American Airlines because Southwest told us that they wouldn’t have anything for another 2 days. One of the Southwest representatives said that they would return $311.96 per person, gave me a receipt told me it would return to my credit card within two days which was a lie. I spent over $2000 on a rental car and new tickets in order to get home for work thinking I was getting my money back, as I was told. I will no longer be flying Southwest, the customer service is terrible!"
922,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a change of last name that I e-mailed well back in Jan 2019. Upon requesting how to get my last name change, I was not informed that I should also include any upcoming flight reservation numbers. That being said, only my Rapid Rewards profile was updated on the site, nothing else. I didn't know what to make of this by the time I went to fly out. I was allowed to fly with my old married last name with no issues, but was almost left to not be allowed to get on the plane from Austin because my ID didn't match my boarding pass name. This caused me to nearly miss my flight and I rushed to the gate losing 4 items!  I've never in my life lost so many items in my life- especially not all at once! I was incredibly flustered. I lost 2 items at Austin, one on a plane going to Nashville, then at the Nashville Airport before boarding my flight back to Chicago. The incorrect last name was Baker instead of Anderson. I called to their Customer Service headquarters to where the best they could do was offer me a voucher of $100. That's not even enough for a free flight (round trip) to anywhere! They seriously don't care about their customers because aside from using this voucher, I will no longer be using their flight services again. I didn't even get a promised drink from Nashville into Chicago. I also landed without a jacket (because this was one of my 4 lost items) and ended up freezing. I've reported my lost items twice! TWICE! Because after you call in to report a claim of a lost item, they insist that you fill out a document of theirs to be submitted via e-mail on top of it. This company makes all sorts of excuses as to why they won't do anything further. They say that they had no idea I had an upcoming flight based on my RR#. I had no idea they even needed it! So, they can't point blame on me. What happened to the ""Customer's always right!"" attitude? I'll be taking my business elsewhere and I recommend everyone else does the same! I get that they are not responsible for lost items; however, I would not have lost any of those items if I hadn't been flustered to missing my plane to begin with- so yes, it is their fault when I've never lost anything at airports in my life! I'm very disappointed in this airline company and I cannot wait to use their voucher to just move on to another airline company."
923,"✅ Trip Verified | I'd rather fly harnessed to the wing of a JetBlue flight than fly Southwest. Worst airline ever, continually lets me down. Started our trip off with an overcrowded flight where I couldn't rest my arm without bumping into a stranger. This was an international flight by the way, 5 hours. Then on the way back we went from Punta Cana to Chicago, then back to Baltimore. Added at least 3 hours to my travel time. Then when we finally arrived in Baltimore they lost my girlfriends luggage so I had to wait for another flight to land and see if it was there, but it wasn’t. So they had to mail it to me. All they gave me for this was a 100 dollar travel voucher, which I will never be able to use because I don’t plan on using their airline again."
924,"✅ Trip Verified |  After being stuck in Denver for 3 days and not email to let us know our flight was canceled to to weather, we finally discovered we had to act fast as the airlines were filling up fast. We were told the soonest a flight home would be is 3 days away. After spending more money and extending out stay, I asked if Southwest Airlines could upgrade our boarding zone to B instead of C as it’s first come first serve, the answer was no. We could purchase upgrade. Both the man on the phone and multiple customer service were unsympathetic towards our situation as we were stranded for 3 days. I’ll never fly Southwest Airlines again."
925,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Columbus via Orlando. I recently thought I’d try another airline other than Delta and decided to take a chance on Southwest. Flight attendant was making extremely unprofessional comments over the loud speaker. Secondly, On the way there and the way back we didn’t make it on time once. Thought no big deal, delays happen. Called customer service to try and bump flights. Estimated wait time 130 minutes. A company shouldn’t even be allowed to say they have customer service with a 130 minute phone wait time.  Do not fly with Southwest."
926,"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest continues to underwhelm. I think I’ve finally had enough. They just cancelled my return flight with no explanation. Literally no code is available to the agent explaining the reason. Clearly it is so they can maximize profits during a busy week of flights. Now, my family of 7 is stranded with no rental cars and no hotels available during spring break week. The next available flight home is 4 days away. What are we to do? Sleep outside? On top of it all, the customer service agent put me on a “brief hold” only to hang up on me because my call to figure out options was taking too long for her. I hate you Southwest. Never again. And I will tell everyone I meet about this experience."
927,"✅ Trip Verified |  Atlanta to Punta Cana. Hostesses were extremely rude and inconsiderate. Very unprofessional. Wouldn’t recommend flying Southwest if you have an another alternative. Flight itself was fine, but our group was treated extremely poorly."
928,✅ Trip Verified | Dallas to Orlando. I hate this airline. This was the first time for me with Southwest and this is the most horrible airline I have travelled with. No professionalism at all. Rude staff. No seats assigned (seriously)! I will not fly Southwest Airlines ever again.
929,"✅ Trip Verified |  There was a slight delay in departure from Dallas to Washington; however this delay was made up in the air. On DAL-DCA leg, the aircraft was 737-800. This aircraft with the new Boeing interior design is brighter with curved overhead bins. Seating is very comfortable with ample leg room. Service was the typical Southwest fare. On the PVD-DAL leg, the aircraft was a 737-700. Again, there was a slight delay. We were fortunate to be seated in the very first row thus we had all the extra leg room. WiFi on both flights was excellent."
930,"✅ Trip Verified |  Providence to Dallas via Washington DC. Both flights departed on time with no issues in the boarding process and/or during in flight. Service was typical of Southwest. Flight Attendants come around and take your order for drinks and service snacks. Both flights were on B737-700. On the PVD-DCA leg, there was enough leg room to seat in comfort. The same could not be said for the DCA-DAL leg. The seating area felt cramped even though this was the same type of aircraft we flew in on from Providence."
931,✅ Trip Verified |  Baltimore to Tampa. I had surgery 6 days prior and had medical documentation stating I was not to lift anything over 2 pounds or walk extended distances. I was not even supposed to fly but I was going to see a specialist on Maryland so the restrictions were put in place and we arranged wheelchair assistance. I had zero issues the flight to BWI. The trip back was an absolute nightmare and completely unacceptable. We landed in Tampa after a turbulent flight which in turn heightened my pain. I was 1 of 5 people that had boarded with wheelchair assistance. When we landed we were advised that the wheelchairs weren't available yet. Fortunately the other 4 people were able to walk off the aircraft without a problem. I advised the stewardess of my restrictions and stated I would wait. Everyone had gotten off and the stewardess asked me to walk off. I again told her I could not. They cleaned the plane a bit and again told me I needed to get off. I did not fight it and advised them I could not lift my bag and they carried it off for me and had me stand in pain in the alleyway and wait with the entire crew. She then said I needed to go so I slowly started walking and walked most the alley way where I was then greeted with a wheelchair. The attendant then took off hitting the bump off the gate. I told him I just had surgery but clearly he was in a hurry. This is absolutely unacceptable. I legitimately needed help and had arranged for assistance on advance with documentation stating my restrictions. If there weren't any wheelchairs available I should not have been forced to walk in pain when I was advised by a medical professional otherwise. I had physical proof with me and this trip was not made by choice. I called and filed a complaint with customer service and was advised I would get a response within 10 days. This is unacceptable! My husband and I have always flown Southwest and never had an issue. 
932,Not Verified |  Salt Lake City to to Bradley via Chicago. All male flight attendant crew - In this day and age it was nice to see a whole male flight attendant crew on the aircraft. They were all professional and very nice especially the lead. With southwest's mission being based and rooted upon great personality they have met that expectation and more. Even with a difficult passenger a few rows in front of me complaining about a simple task of putting his belongings under the seat the lead still remained pleasant and professional. Shout out to the crew for their hard work and positive work ethic! Need more crews like them.
933,Not Verified |  Thursday 2/21/19 receive an alert on my app my flight to Houston is cancelled. No reason given. The flight had a stop and plane Change in Las Vegas. I have a seminar that I cannot miss I spend an hour on hold and an hour online trying to rebook with Southwest no luck book with Spirit airlines. I find the contact link to SWA and send a message cancel my return trip also stating I cannot wait to book a flight and I have one on another airlines. One hour later I receive a call from SWA can we work something out. No I have already booked a new flight cancel and refund my money. Today I check my e-mail and I have a no reply answer from them. It states the flight was cancelled for inclement weather. Las Vegas received an inch of snow on Thursday. I lived in Vegas for 30 years and in 2008 the airport received 8” of snow and they did not cancel flights. Then I get a CNN news alert that SWA is cancelling flights all over because of a mechanics negotiations that has gone on for two years. It appears that most flights in or out of Las Vegas are cancelling. 
934,"Not Verified |  Milwaukee to Denver. Boarding process - check in to get boarding location to discover passengers are allowed to board and save seats for people that have a later boarding assignment. Will not fly this airline again, but people need to know that according to their customer service department - saving seats is allowed. If you fly this airline - have one person purchase early bird or business class and have that person board and save as many seats as you need for the people in your party."
935,"✅ Trip Verified |  Minneapolis to Dallas via Chicago. I had flight on Feb 23 early morning at 7:40 Am initially from MSP to Dallas. There was no snow but they still cancelled the flight. Rescheduled to 10:30 am, they just cancelled again. For next day feb 24 I rescheduled to flight for early morning 7am, it got cancelled again. Rescheduled to 10:15 Am flight later it also got cancelled. To be frank I guess they don’t have enough people to fly in their flight so they just cancelled flight by saying weather conditions. Because I have all my friends traveled on both days without any problem since there is no snow. It has very bad customer service. I would not recommend them for my future travel"
936,"Not Verified |  Chicago to St Louis. Southwest canceled our Flight at 10 pm the night before our trip. The weather was not the reason since their other flights flew. We were given a phone number to call. There was a 105 minute wait to reschedule. Since most flights on this route are close to or totally fully booked we returned by train. Since the last 3 trips on this route have had 3 hour delays twice and a 1 hour 20 minute delay once, we will fly other airlines. This is the second time in 3 years a flight was canceled."
937,"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest used to be a decent airline, but has recently declined in service. We took our 6 year old daughter to Disney. Our return flight was canceled without notification. To make matters worse, when I asked the attendant at the gate, I was told it was because of “weather”. Being skeptical of this “weather” related issue, I called Southwest customer service number and was told the real answer which was the the flight was canceled due to maintenance issues. So not only was I not informed of the cancellation, they lied to me at the gate. This is not the first time this has happened; last time I was on business. This is my last trip on Southwest. Unacceptable! Especially when you’re traveling with a child. Southwest, Get your act together!"
938,✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Oklahoma City. Our flight was cancelled and I did not get an email until right before I was checking luggage. Others got an email the day before. Then we booked another flight late that night to get a cancellation 5 minutes making the reservations. They didn't have any flights back to Tulsa until 2 days later. I had to fly into OKC and drive the rest of the way. The line was so long I got out after standing in the same spot for 40 minutes. I didn't get anything for this trouble.
939,✅ Trip Verified |  Tampa to Atlanta. Terrible airline. Late getting to Atlanta. Extremely late leaving Atlanta. Fight to Atlanta there air cart broke. Which I’m sure the reason they even need an air cart is because they have terrible maintenance. This is a 24 hr 365 operation. T
940,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to New Orleans. My originally flight from Oakland to LAX with connection flight LAX to MSY was postponed due to mechanical windshield wiper motor error. Our flight was changed 3 times with the best option staying with original flight and hoping plane would be fixed. After 4 hours we finally flew to LAX where we had to wait in baggage claim for 3 hours and argue to get a hotel (reminder that we missed our connection flight home due to southwest equipment malfunction). Southwest gave us a voucher for travel to and from hotel but second voucher could not be plugged into app as payment. Staffs response was “I don’t know how to help you.” Staff was unhelpful and inefficient having to contact supervisor for hotel then travel arrangements to and from hotel. We had NO direct contact or conversation with the manager. Once we arrived to the hotel which was 30 minutes away from the airport, the service desk attendant told us they never received a call from southwest and hopefully she could find us a room. We decided to Uber back to LAX and payed on our expense due to voucher not working. Get to southwest for 7am flight after 3 hours of sleep due to inefficiency of staff and wasting our time trying to figure out processes which should already be in place. Flight from LAX to MSY was delayed yet again 2 hours due to mechanical errors. I asked the desk attendant if I could have more specifics to document for work and the response I received was “I don’t know anything further” and when I asked if there will be an announcement as to why flight was delayed the response I got was “no we are inspecting the plane and when it is safe to fly then we will notify you”. Awaiting flight in airport which total hours spent is 15+ hours and counting for this one flight on my birthday."
941,✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Sacramento. Well this is the second time in a row this has happen with southwest. I and my husband are active military and never received baggage claim. We have important places we need to be at a certain time and don’t have time to wait days without our military belongings. This is ridiculous. They’re service wasn’t great. They didn’t seem to care of the situations we had come across. This is a disaster. Don’t think I’ll ever travel with them again.
942,"Not Verified |  Raleigh to Denver. Huge fan of Southwest. I will use them whenever possible over any other airline. However, not a huge fan of the ""early-bird check-in"" feature. The past 2 times I purchased it, it did not work. Did not check me in and gave me a much lower boarding number. The first time I caught it close enough and was able to get B1 but when I brought it up to customer service at the gate they just kinda shrugged and said ""that's weird, it shouldn't have sold it to you when we didn't have any more available"" and that was it. No apology, no refund offer, no anything. The second time, even though I'd paid for early bird, I made sure I was prepared to check myself in just in case. Glad I did. It didn't work again. I checked myself in and again brought it up to the gate agent and customer service - again, just a shrug and ""weird"". No apology. No refund offer. Nothing. It's very confusing to me, because Southwest has amazing customer service in all other avenues in my experience. But with early bird check in, they just don't care if it works or not. It's an additional $15 per person in my party that they pocketed. So, now I continue to use Southwest, but I don't upgrade to the early bird check in. It's not worth it when it's unreliable."
943,"Not Verified |  Buffalo to Phoenix. I had an amazing experience with Southwest on February 2,2019. Due to a reversal of departure time, I arrived at the airport stressed and late. The staff was amazing. The ticket agent checked my luggage quickly with a late check in tag. I was doubtful it would make the flight. I raced to the gate and the gate agent was wonderful and so helpful. She assured me my luggage would arrive - and she was right. My luggage and I both arrived in Phoenix together and on time. Fabulous experience with Southwest."
944,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Phoenix. What is the point of Southwest being open seating if people are savings seats for those who didn't check in on time. My husband and I were in the A group and we're declined seating by multiple parties until there was companioned seating on the back half of the plane. Pretty ridiculous. This service gets a 0 for me as when I told the flight attendant, nothing was done."
945,"Not Verified |  Phoenix to Michigan. I love Southwest, my daughter and I made Phoenix our home November of 2016 and we both have flown different airlines back and forth. She sometimes travel alone as a unaccompanied minor and no airline gave her such a great experience on her flight. Thank you Southwest and a special thank you to the pilot. She was excited to sit in the cockpit."
946,"✅ Trip Verified |  Portland to Los Angeles. Southwest Airlines cancelled my direct flight due to ""Maintenance"" or ""Weather Issues"" (Employees did not have the same reason) then I'm forced to choose a connecting flight with a 3 hour layover. In addition, my replacement flights got delayed causing me hours of my own life?! I hope everyone reads this and let this be a lesson to not use Southwest Airlines."
947,"✅ Trip Verified |  Ontario to Oakland. The website does not make it immediately clear that 2 free bags checked does not include a guitar. That's annoying. Financially, this flight was a bad decision, and has made me decide I won't fly southwest again."
948,✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Louisville. Zero problems. Great service there and back. Seats are not luxurious but ok. Plane was a newer one and nice. Paid extra to get front row seat but it was worth it. WIFI worked good even though it cost extra. Would definitely fly Southwest again.
949,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hartford to Tampa. The fact that we were significantly delayed tonight by 2 hr. 40 min. isn't even the motivation behind this review. It's not even the constant WiFi problems we experience every single flight. The main reason is Southwest's lack of heart. I was A-List Preferred and have flown SW exclusively for a few years now. I was three flights short in 2018 to maintain my A-List Preferred status, and I emailed them explaining that the reason I was short was because I was forced to fly Delta a few times due to Southwest cancelling or delaying the flights in question. It was such a light-hearted plea, too. I thought surely in the name of customer experience, they'll understand and appreciate the fact that I'm loyal to them still and they'll do the right thing. Not so much, unfortunately. Instead, I get this canned email response below. ""We received your email and appreciate your taking the time to contact us. As a valued Customer of Southwest Airlines, your feedback is very important to us, and we welcome the opportunity to respond. A-List and A-List Preferred status provides lucrative benefits to recognize and reward our most loyal Customers, and we must rely on our Rapid Rewards Members to gain entry to these tier levels through their activity in the program. I truly understand your frustration given that you were only three flights shy of qualifying for A-List Preferred. In order to maintain the integrity of our Rapid Rewards program and continue to provide the perks associated with each tier status, we must consistently adhere to the program rules. Saying “no” to a request for tier status that has not been truly earned helps ensure that we are able to say “yes” to offering benefits to our qualifying Members in the future. Your patronage and loyalty has not gone unnoticed. It's our hope that you will continue flying Southwest Airlines as it would be our privilege to welcome you onboard for many years to come. Sincerely, Nancy, Southwest Airlines"""
950,✅ Trip Verified | Atlanta to Chicago. I have horrible anxiety and gets worse when I need to fly. I am a person that believe my feet belong on the ground. Well I had to take a business trip solo and never flown alone. I saw the pilot coming from grabbing some lunch so I approached him to see if he was flying the plane or going home. If he was going home I was going to ask to sit next to him to help with my fears. He was the flying pilot. He asked me if everything was ok and I told him I was very scared and nervous. He told me it was going to be ok and a smooth short ride. I thanked him for the conversation and went to wait in line to board. Well a few mins into waiting a wonderful man came and said to come with him. They allowed me on the plane and introduced me to everyone working on the plane. The wonderful gentlemen told me to pick any seat and he would sit next to me and guide me through the sounds and bumps so I know I’m safe. Everyone working on flight 1599 was so amazing. I wish I knew each and everyone name working that day to call and tell their bosses how much I appreciate everything they did to help me feel better. Thank you so much Southwest Airlines. You all are amazing and I hope your bosses know this. I cannot thank you enough for taking the extra time to help me.
951,✅ Trip Verified |  Oakland to Las Vegas. It’s the worst airline I’ve flown. I’ve only departed on time approximately 50 percent of the time. Alaska is  better. Only gave it a zero because there’s not a lower choice
952,"✅ Trip Verified |  Indianapolis to Ft Myers. From the beginning of the flight to the end, our stewardess, Deborah was a consummate professional. There was a screaming baby, people were not loading with consideration of others in mind, but Deborah took it all in stride. Her beaming smile and wonderful compassion to this harried new parent was a refreshing change to those of us used to being just 'another number' in the airline industry. If Southwest keeps employing stellar employees like Deborah, I will no longer even search out the competition. Quality beats any of the other items that I could possibly consider. Thank you again, Deborah."
953,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sacramento to San Diego. On the flight out, the plane pulled away from the gate on time, only to sit on the tarmac for an hour so they could complete a repair. But of course, this was considered an ""on time departure"". On the return flight, the captain informed us that something was dropped under the captains chair, and they had to remove the chair and an access panel to retrieve it. I kid you not. After 45 minutes the captain came out of the cockpit, picked up the intercom, and with a grin on his face, showed the entire passenger area the item that was retrieved, a cupholder. Just great. I feel so confident flying with Southwest."
954,Not Verified |  Our plane from Baltimore Washington to Aruba had some minor mechanical issues forcing us to divert to San Juan instead of flying directly on to Aruba. There was another plane waiting for us in San Juan and we were able to make it to Aruba 3 hours late which was great considering the diversion. The best part of the story is a few hours later we received a voucher each for $150 from SWA for the delay. Considering we used points and my wife flew on a companion fare(free) it cost me nothing for the flight. SWA handled the problem well and we arrived only three hours behind schedule when it could have been a much longer delay. They were so smart with sending out vouchers to all of us in a timely manner.
955,"Not Verified | Tucson to Kansas City. Never again Southwest doesn't take care of problems. Flight had mechanical issue. Not a problem. Once we had to get off. Only 2 employees to help reroute 150 some of passengers. Once I got a confirmation on new flight from text, they couldn't give me a boarding pass. Finally got new part several hrs later. We boarded again. It took to long on run way. I missed any other flight. Got rebooked again. 6 hrs later I get to KC. No luggage! Now I'm mad. It was a joke flying with Southwest. No organization at all."
956,"✅ Trip Verified |  On December 26, 2018 I flew my daughter back to California from Phoenix. Her luggage that was checked in was opened and checked by Homeland Security. We did not know the suitcase was checked until the next day in the afternoon. My daughter and I decided to put her Christmas gift cards; PlayStation, Ross, and Burlington, in the selfie light box that she got for Christmas as well thinking they would be safe. Not the case! When my daughter open the selfie light box to retrieve her gift cards because her mother was taking her shopping that day she discovered that the Burlington gift card had been stolen. What a disappointment. My daughter is 14 years old and this was her first experience flying and this is the treatment she received from a dishonest employee. I contacted Southwest and they sent me an email stating that the missing item, my daughter's Burlington gift card is not covered. I feel ripped off and appalled that Southwest does not take responsibility for such misconduct. "
957,"✅ Trip Verified |  Long Island to Baltimore. I have always experienced excellent service from Southwest Airlines except in the area of TSA. The TSA constantly reminds me that it is not their fault that pre-check is not open or in Albany's case, pre-check has no body scanner for pre-check. I know SW is not responsible for TSA agents but since they have not sent me the usual evaluation form, here I am. I met my 1st obnoxious agent ever on 12/27 at 9:45 am at ISP. I asked why pre-check was not open and he yelled at me that it was not his fault. It was SW's. Since I had packed for pre-check screening, it took me a little time to locate liquids. He badgered me the entire time, with a loud voice. At one point he asked the woman behind me if she was his witness. She asked for what and he shut up. The woman who did the extensive pat-down was excellent! And how about this? At BWI my luggage was on the carousel before I arrived there!"
958,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight 3063 had fabulous flight on 12/30 from Orlando to Baltimore thanks to amazing flight attendants. They were both very kind and friendly. Made holiday travel a very nice experience. My thanks and kudos to both gentlemen. Awesome team. 
959,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Sacramento. No interest in helping passengers. They create arbitrary timelines regarding departure time and announcements, with no real structure. Their ability to brush off all customer concerns and ""pass off"" customers to avoid problems overshadows the prices for flights. They are cheap for a reason. Consistently stuck on planes waiting for passengers on one flight, and on the next they turn multiple people away. They state they do hard paperwork for the pilot before each flight, which must be untrue if they pilot comes walking on 5 minutes before departure. Another example of an airline that overbooks passengers. When asked about the status of my luggage, I was informed of a new ""system"" to check luggage. The employee stated she could not see where my luggage went due to the new system. This is a joke Southwest. It is so easy to be an honest and compassionate company, yet you challenge yourself daily by treating customers (the ones that buy the tickets) like second class citizens. I will not be flying Southwest and have since been using Alaska airlines, with no problems."
960,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to Dallas via Houston. I have been contacting Southwest Airlines to get my check-in bags which was sent from Boston to Dallas. They canceled my flight my connecting flights initially and I was stuck in Houston for hours asking for another flight before I was given another flight to Dallas which got a layover of 7 hours in Oklahoma City. When I reached Dallas, they have no idea where my checked-in bags are. Tried contacting baggage claim office. They were not interested in helping me. Tried contacting customer care. They couldn't help either. Tried contacting baggage office last 24 hours multiple times, but no answer. I am stuck in this city with no clothes and I have to leave from here tomorrow. Now they have ruined my trip and my new agenda for today is to take an Uber and go to the airport which is 20 miles away and check with them if my bags have reached."
961,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have been trying to get home for the last 36 hours. Weather delayed my flight at first (which is obviously not their fault) but then the aircraft landed us in a different state, kicked us off, left our luggage and left us. I was then thrown onto a random flight that wouldn’t even be getting me home. I arrived in the middle of the night and they gave me no ticket to even get home. After I went to the counter to get a new flight home it would be another 18 hours before I could board. My luggage was left behind in the other state because of their sloppy work of throwing me onto a different flight at random and I have no clue when I will be getting it. My father is now driving 4 hours to pick me up because Southwest has stranded me at 2 different airports and gave out no hotel vouchers. Therefore I have been in airport chairs for the last 16 hours and I have 13 more to go. Bless my dad for stepping up!!"
962,✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix  to Cleveland. I will never fly Southwest Airlines again. You get up early to check in so you may have the luxury of choosing a seat and if you're traveling with loved ones being able to sit next to them. Well my partner and I got a B boarding pass 35 + 36. When we finally get to board we see these personal items of somebody's placed on two rows of seating. When my fiance and I go to sit down we are told those seats are being saved for someone else's family members. Obviously those family members did not get up to get a higher boarding number. When I asked the stewardess if that was allowed the stewardess replied we don't regulate the seating. Needless to say my fiance and I we're separated during a very long flight. Also we ordered drinks and the stewardesses sat in the back giggling and laughing with each other rather than doing their job we didn't get our drinks until we had to ask them not once but twice. I have been a faithful Southwest customer so has my mother two sisters aunt and many cousins I have told my whole family about my experience and we all agree to never fly Southwest again. Next time I need to fly I will pay the extra money and Fly Frontier Airlines that way I'll pay an extra couple of bucks but at least I know I'll be sitting with the person I'm traveling with and where I want to. Southwest Airlines you've got a lot of cleaning up to do and until then you just lost a lot of business from my family
963,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tulsa to Houston via Dallas. I pay extra for Business class every time to board first. Southwest boards all the pre-boarding first and places them all in the front rows. It’s not worth the money to pay extra! Fly American where you know what seat you will be in. It’s absolutely a rip off to pay the extra when the first 4 to 6 rows are already filled up when you get on. Then they try to give you one free drink if you will move seats. Not trying to be an asshole, but the people who preboard don’t pay extra. It’s ridiculous to pay extra when you get nothing from it. I fly at least twice a month and now I know why I don’t fly with them very often."
964,"Not Verified |  Baltimore to Los Angeles. Traveled with 17 month old daughter and husband. We got a red eye flight. Daughter was not having it and started screaming crying for about half the fight. One flight attendant in particular kept questioning me if this was our first time flying and why my daughter was acting up. I told her she’s 17 months old to which she replied “In my 20 years of experience experience, I’ve traveled with a lot of toddlers.” Made me feel as if something was wrong with my daughter or me being a bad mother. Never again will I fly with Southwest. I’ve heard bad experiences from family and friends that traveled with Southwest, but now that I have experienced it myself, I’ve had enough."
965,"Not Verified | Orlando to Nashville. I arrived at the airport 3 hours prior to my boarding time. Once I checked in I was notified that my flight was delayed. No big deal. Then it was delayed 3 more times. Then it was canceled. I understand that it was raining when I arrived at the airport, but according to the radar there was no serious weather conditions at my current location nor at my destination. Other Southwest planes were leaving left and right. I tried calling customer service, but was put on hold and never got in touch with a real agent. Everything was automated. I’ll fly Delta next time."
966,"✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to Philadelphia. This is our first time flying with the SouthWest airlines, but I wasn't happy coming back from Orlando,FL - Philadelphia,PA. Check in staff told us that we can board as a family of 5 together. But boarding staff was rude and unpleasant not letting us in, because apparently SouthWest has policy that family can board together only with kids 6 and under. I have a 10y.o.kid and we were scalded and shouted on us many times in front the other people that we just would like to cut the line with small children. She didn't had any rights to humiliate me and my family like this. It wasn't handled this situation intelligent way at all. After this we were seated the last ones on the airplane and basically all of the seats were taken. Our family was scattered all over the airplane, because South West have open seated option. I was surprised that they found two seats for me and my 10 yo.son. I'm not sure what the management thought by this decision, but many families on the airplane was unhappy. I would recommend changing it. People didn't wanted to switch the seats and everybody felt like imprisoned for a couple of hours. I'm happy that it was 2h 25min. flight and never buying cheap tickets anymore from this airline. You should change a lot in your policies and retrain your staff how to handle conflict situations with customers."
967,"✅ Trip Verified |  I just got off flight 9 to San Diego from Austin and the three flight attendants were so amazing. My 18 month old daughter was very fussy and not wanting to sleep and the three flight attendants were quick to help! The FA's offered to walk her up and down the plane for me,  made sure we had plenty of juice, and kept us supplied with crackers and even made a makeshift baby rattle for her!!Hands down the best service I’ve ever received during a flight. Normally I would’ve felt embarrassed or judged but they didn’t. I will definitely be only flying southwest from now on!"
968,"✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Orlando. Flying Southwest was affordable, amazing customer service, very easy check-in, and TSA preferred is delightful. If Southwest is flying to my destination, it’s my first choice."
969,"✅ Trip Verified |  Oakland to Las Vegas. It was over an hour late it took forever to board and then once it boarded we proceeded to sit at the gate for 30 minutes because of a missing bag from another flight. I am extremely disappointed, I’m still sitting here at the gate this very moment. Will think long and hard before I fly Southwest again."
970,✅ Trip Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to San Jose. No mobile boarding passes. Had to wait in line for a boarding pass like it was still the 20th century. Made me check in 36 hours in advance since a purchase extra benefits whereas with any other airline I would just be given a seat next to my girlfriend was not able to take a 3rd luggage and no overweight and I offer to paid I end up leaving so many gifts behind for family that I have not seen in long time. Wifi on flight was good and reasonably priced. Overall would not recommend.
971,"Not Verified |  This airline is terrible, I had a flight from Nashville to Jacksonville with a layover in Atlanta to switch planes. On both flights the southwest employees had us board the plane only to make us sit at the terminal because something was broken on the plane. I don't know if the maintenance staff with Southwest is the worst of all airlines or they buy the cheapest planes, but it's ridiculous. I will never fly this airline again, I don't care how cheap the flights are. "
972,"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Detroit. Staff on this flight was rude. Captain talking down about competitor on overhead. Attendants were unprofessional and seemed unhappy. Seats are tight, price was too high for being uncomfortable 3 hours and 11 minutes. I will try my best never to use this airline again. We were told the WiFi wasn't working. Very poor customer service."
973,"Not Verified |  Providence to Tampa.  I arrived at the airport today after speaking with the pet policy department 3 times. I was assured that my new puppy would be able to travel in a pet approved carrier and as long as he was less than 25lbs. When I got to the counter he was denied travel because they he was too big, he is a Bernese Mountain puppy I had documentation showing he weighed 16 lbs! I am a rewards member and was a frequent flyer on Southwest, needless to say our Christmas is ruined and I won’t be flying them anytime soon. Rhode Island staff are incredibly the rudest people ever and I can’t even begin to tell you how angry I am. T"
974,✅ Trip Verified | Cleveland to San Antonio. So I was on my way to Lackland Air Force Base to see my nephew graduate I decided to schedule the flight with Southwest. The experience was wonderful. I like the fact that they acknowledge veterans on the flights that’s hard to come by these days. I booked the flights directly through Southwest using their app on my phone. We flew out of Cleveland to Atlanta then to San Antonio. The return flight was from San Antonio to Baltimore then to Cleveland.
975,✅ Trip Verified | Flew San Diego to Phoenix. Every time I have flown SouthWest the flight is almost always delayed and the staff are unpleasant. It’s good if you are on a budget but overall the whole flight experience is stressful and plan ahead for a late flight. When I asked why the flight was late apparently the staff weren't even there?
976,Not Verified | No mobile boarding passes. Had to wait in line for a boarding pass like it was still the 20th century. Made me check in 24 hours in advance whereas with any other airline I would just be given a seat next to my girlfriend. Wifi on flight was good and reasonably priced. Overall would not recommend.
977,"✅ Trip Verified |  El Paso to San Antonio. So if you ask for assistance lifting your bag over your head you cannot sit in the emergency exit row. I am a law student and figured I’d add the heavy books to my luggage over the backpack. Well I should have checked my bag because when I asked for a boost to push the bag in the flight attendant first said she had a hurt shoulder and couldn’t do much to assist. She gave it a light push. Then when the bag was up she said if I couldn’t lift my bag over my head I couldn’t sit in the emergency exit row. The 70 year old man with the tiny bag could, but I could not. The elderly couple (the wife could not lift her own bag but her husband lifted it for her) could sit in the emergency exit row. Last time I sat in that row a former pilot assisted me in putting up my bag and did not flag down a flight attendant or even mention that if I could not lift my bag I can’t sit there. The flight attendant could not lift my bag, yet she is still able to work and presumably can open the door. Further, the guests in the emergency exit row were drinking cocktails. Intoxication seems to render them fit. I have already addressed this issue with Southwest on Twitter and they do not seem to care. I lifted my bag from the overhead bin myself and made a mental note to not ask for help/check my bag in the future so my 6 ft tall stature can sit comfortably in the future. This is merely a warning to future customers."
978,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Indianapolis to Dallas for four days, for a family Thanksgiving. My bag never made it on the flight. Upon arriving to Dallas, we immediately filed for a lost bag. They located the bag and said they would deliver it. I had to wait two days before my bag got there, which was half of my vacation. The compensation for the inconvenience we got was the bag delivery itself. That is down right ridiculous. I had to buy clothes and bathroom supplies for Southwest Airlines mistake. This was extremely unprofessional and I will probably never fly Southwest Airlines again."
979,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline I’ve ever had. The only reason I used Southwest was because they were definitely cheaper than other airlines, however I am very disappointed with them. I fly at least once a month with them and every single time, there is a delay with the plane and not just a short delay."
980,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am so thankful to be coming home this week to work at Corporate, and to spend Thanksgiving with family and friends. A big shout out to Southwest as I booked my ticket in reverse from Columbus to Tampa leaving today except I’m in Tampa! They were able to get me home today still on the next direct flight and fixed my ticket for the following Tuesday. They even let me keep my incredible price of $199.96 round trip. This is why I fly Southwest regularly. It pays to be a loyal flyer!"
981,✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Chicago. This is the last time I get screwed by this airline. I will never buy a ticket from this airline again. Flight was supposed to leave at 2.35pm it's 4pm and still waiting. This is by far the most terrible airline service.
982,"✅ Trip Verified |  Raleigh to Orlando. Nothing bad, service-wise, to say about my trip (RDU-MCO-RDU). The outbound flight was delayed five minutes coming from Phoenix but had 25 empty seats and let customers spread out. Arrived in Orlando on time. Inbound flight back to Raleigh was packed full and arrived 10 minutes early. Service was friendly both ways. Southwest Airlines will continue to get my business for future trips."
983,"✅ Trip Verified |  Oklahoma City to Chicago. My flight was delayed multiple times and their customer service sucks . The staff needs better training as they do not know what they are talking about. It took the 5th rep to be able to tell me the true answer to my issue after being told and promised something different. They do not honor what they say. Make sure you get it in writing because all you will get is a ""I'm sorry this is policy. We will address this internally."" I wasted 4 hours on the phone with them. "
984,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tampa to Los Angeles via Denver. Just beware of Southwest Airlines “Business select”. When you use the word “Business” in relation to air travel, it usually means: a wider seat, more legroom, better meal service, prioritised baggage and lounge access. If you tick the box and pay for this so called upgrade you get none of those things. Fair enough, you have some fare flexibility and the bags go free. Apart from that and a free drink coupon, you get an economy seat and economy treatment. You get to board early. And, it cost me a lot of money, a few hundred dollars for this so called upgrade - you could say that I should have taken the time to read the fine print, but I made the error of thinking that Business meant Business. My advice - it’s a scam and don’t bother with it."
985,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Jose to Portland. My flight got delayed a lot and I tried to catch an early one. I was first on the waiting list, A class. Luckily they had one empty seat so I was prepared to go to the door when a very SW employee flirting around with the male passengers told me that there is somebody else in front of me, specifically her latest flirt. Normally I would have not care much since it was a long shot to get on an early flight but her indolence made me fight for my seat. Her supervisor came, of course said it's me who is supposed to be in the plane and that she will try to make it right. The captain came and help with one more seat. Their help was much appreciated but for me this was last time flying with SW. Too many delays, non-professional crew and higher price compared with the other airlines without any comfort for the money. This happened on 11/09/18 flight 2199 from SJC to PDX  (the delayed flight was 0107)."
986,"✅ Trip Verified | Richmond to Phoenix via Atlanta. They lost my bag on veterans day. What a nice way to say thanks to an OEF and OIF veteran. What really annoyed me and spurned this review was finding out that this airline doesn't scan bag tags at loading/unloading and track bag movement like the other airlines. How can this not be integrated into a major us airlines technology infrastructure in 2018? Unacceptable. Furthermore, Southwest refuses to admit that the bag was lost and is instead just ""delayed."" Garbage. When I asked the agent where the bag was, she couldn't tell me (since they don't track). I then asked her what you call it when you don't know where something is. Her answer? Lost. I needed what was in the bag to prep for a business meeting on Monday which I am now unable to do."
987,"Not Verified | Puerto Vallarta to Houston via Dallas. It's not so hard to understand that delays happen, but we have had more than one delay trying to get from Puerto Vallarta to Dallas, and the workers are absolutely terrible about keeping customers up to date on what's going on."
988,"Not Verified |  Originally going from Grand Rapids to Birmingham,  through Chicago Midway. The GR flight was delayed 3 hours so I would miss my connection. I asked customer service if I could drive to midway and catch the connection. They said no that was not possible to do, but would rebook me on a different flight. I drove to midway for the rebooked flight to find that it too was delayed by more than 3 hrs and would miss my connection in Tampa. So they rebooked me on the second leg of the original flight (the one customer service said was not possible to get on). Sat at Chicago Midway for 3.5 hrs only to find that this flight too was now delayed 2.5 hours. None of these delays were due to weather by the way. I have now had 10 of my last 12 Southwest flights delayed. Shame on me for continuing to use this sub par airline. I guess I’m a glutton for punishment."
989,"Not Verified |  Tampa to Nashville . I tried to check-in 24 hours early to get a good seating position. No checking button, but there was an early bird option. I clicked and paid. It said I would be checked in early, but didn't see any boarding info. I kept refreshing screen to see if it would give a check-in button. Finally, about 5 min after the 24 hour advance period, it gave me the checkin button and I checked in. Now have position B44. I have never had B44 when checking in right at the 24 hr mark. This was because the screen didn't give me the button. SW is obviously giving preference to other people and delaying the checkin button for others. Horrible service. Like traveling in a semi trailer full of cattle when you can't check in early. I called and they said that the early bird check-in button checked me in early for the return flight, not the 1st flight. Horrible user experience. Absolutely the worst. In the future I will fly a real airline that actually allows you to have better than a middle seat."
990,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Grand Rapids to San Antonio via Chicago. I have been flying Southwest for years and have been very happy with the airline and Rewards program until this last trip. I checked in my daughter and I 24 hours in advance and it asked me to check a box by each name, obviously can check in a person 1 at a time. That afternoon something happened and my daughter could no longer go. I got on line and went to cancellations. It asked for the passenger name and confirmation number. I put in my daughters name and was able to cancel her flight. Fast forward about 12 hours later and I arrive for my flight at 530am eastern standard time. I was told that my flight had also been cancelled, even though I only ever entered my daughters name. They were able to re-book me, but I had paid 51,000 points for 2 tickets and they re-booked me for 1 ticket at 59,000 points. I called customer service and they could not help. I called customer relations and I was told if I had called them before I re-booked they would have helped. However, they were not even open for business until 7am CST, 2.5 hours after i had to get on a plane. I am thoroughly disgusted with the lack of help and the fact that both flights were cancelled when only 1 name was entered."
991,"✅ Trip Verified | I have flown with Southwest several times, including my very first flight back in December 2017. It was also my 8 year old son’s first flight from STL to Denver and we were all so nervous. It was an extremely early flight, 5:30am departure. When we first boarded, the pilot was standing in the aisle and introduced himself to my son. We told them it was our very first flight ever and he could see that my son was in tears. After introducing himself he told my son that he will safely get us there and will make sure it’s a wonderful flight so he will love flying, so do not worry about a thing, and even showed my son the cockpit area, it made his day, week, year. They also gave him a little airplane sticker pin. We hit a little bit of turbulence on the way however the pilot told us every single time prior to possibly hitting it and even explained why and that it was perfectly safe and how long the turbulence might last. It made us all so comfortable. I have flown at least 20 flights just since then and have yet to have a bad experience with Southwest. Their crew are unbelievable, always going above and beyond for us. My son has flown two more times and looks forward to it every time, gets super excited to meet “his pilots” as he says. And they always shake his hand. We will always fly Southwest."
992,✅ Trip Verified |  Tucson to Sacramento. Flight attendants were super rude. They were not friendly or welcoming what so ever. One lady in particular was extremely rude on this flight. I am never flying Southewest again after how rude the service was!
993,"✅ Trip Verified |  Oakland to San Diego. I missed my flight and Robert from Southwest San Diego helped me get to my destination. He issued me a standby ticket, but later as I was waiting outside for a ride back home, he found me and handed me an actual ticket. He helped me during this difficult time and I am so grateful for him. "
994,"✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to Colombus. Today when I was flying on flight 1490 I had the best time because of an awesome crew and pilots. There was one individual who made the flight very enjoyable, a flight attendant on this flight. He could not have been more awesome or more funny. Loved having him as a flight attendant"
995,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sacramento to Houston via Los Angeles. This airline had me and 50+ passengers delayed for over two hours due to mechanical issues. Don't you think you should get all of us paying passengers to a different, safe and working airplane? The fact that I have waiting over 2 hours because this unorganized airline either doesn't have enough working planes or don't care enough to get us moving."
996,"✅ Trip Verified |  Charlotte to Minneapolis. Our flight was delayed due to other issues than weather leaving Charlotte this evening. In trying to determine whether to book a new flight in Charlotte we asked the staff. We were told that we had ten to fifteen minutes and should sit up front and run to the next concourse. We did not know it was on the other side of the airport. So we upgraded sat up front and ran to B22 in Chicago Midway to make our connection home to Minneapolis. Even though we made it to the gate and saw the plane sitting there, we were told that it was gone and we had to book a flight 3 hours later. And we needed to go back to where we were told to run from. There was no communication to the gate that passengers were running across the airport. This airport is the worst Southwest hub in the world and this was the second and last experience there. Southwest can do better than this."
997,"✅ Trip Verified | Louisville to Baltimore via Portland. Best flight ever. We did have a slight delay in initial take off due to a light being on but the flight attendants were great, funny, kind and made the experience excellent."
998,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Norfolk via Baltimore. I flew out of Houston, TX to Norfolk, VA on 5Oct and was to return on 12Oct. My Daughter's 2nd Birthday was on the 7th of Oct. I went to the gate on the 5th for my departure, nothing was said about having to pay for my daughter's return flight because she was ""2"" now. I go to the airport to depart and was rudely told I need to pay for her ticket, and that the information is on the website - and that she is ""Sorry I didn't read it"". I would assume being in customer service and knowing the regulations that it would have still been told to me when looking at my daughter's Birth Certificate and seeing she turns two within the time of my stay in VA. I called the airline and they told me that I have no choice but to pay $243.80 for my daughter to fly back. I didn't anticipate the money and didn't have it. I had to miss my flight, and go back to a friends house that I stayed with. I didn't have a rental car anymore because I had to turn it in, so I had to wait for someone to come & get my daughter and I. After I got to my friends house I called and spoke withthe Customer Relations Dept and she said she was sorry about my situation and that I could apply for a donation ticket back. I went to the website and read that SWA gives away 40,000 free tickets a year to ""those in need"" but the request can take 6-8 weeks. I have a job I had to get back to, didnt have enough diapers, or anything to continue my stay. So, I called them back. Again, ""I am sorry, but there is no way around it- you'll have to pay"". I told the agent I can pay on the 19th, but will it still be the same amount of money for my daughter to fly back, and how much will it cost to change my reservations. She said they can't guarantee the price will be the same, and that she didn't know how much more out of pocket I would have to come out. I live paycheck to paycheck. I only went to VA because my oldest daughter gave birth to my first Grandchild, and it was important I would be there. I could have left my daughter with my Husband while I was gone if I would have known I had to pay for her return flight back. But since I was stuck there, no one cared and upper management that could have helped me, and also didnt want to get on the phone themselves did not help, nor care I was stranded without a vehicle and no place to go with my 2 year old daughter. I was fortunate enough to reach out to distant family and borrow the money to fly back home with my baby. I have never flown with SWA before, I always chose Delta - and from here on out I will stick with Delta. Not only are the flight attendants rude and their customer service is completely incompetent- they honestly have no heart or no care in the world. The Customer is not their priority."
999,"✅ Trip Verified |  Norfolk to Boston. When connection flight was delayed due to weather, Lynn was able to help me book my connecting flight in order to make my arrival time within 15 minutes. Mother Nature saw fit to delay us again but she went out of her way to help me even after a colleague said it wasn’t possible. Thank you, you are the best at customer service."
