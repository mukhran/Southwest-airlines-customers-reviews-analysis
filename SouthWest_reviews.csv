18, Customer Service was poor on my last flight I was flying from Panama City to New York LGA with a connection in Nashville on a Saturday My first flight was fine in flight beverages and entertainment not great but I have come to expect this with Southwest My second flight got delayed times before ultimately being cancelled at pm Again not usually an issue but they were unable to rebook me until Monday The service desk was not able to get me on a flight the next day at all and also wouldn t let me get on standby for any of the Sunday flights I was willing to accept this however I had no place to stay in Nashville When I requested a comped or discounted hotel room especially considering I was going to need somewhere to stay for two nights they declined siting weather as the reason for cancelation therefore they didn t need to provide hotel accommodation While I understand what s in their contract it is an absolutely awful customer experience to be stranded in a city where you have no connections and are essentially forced to pay for a hotel or sleep in an airport for over hours I would have expected them to either pay for my hotel or try a bit harder to get my on a flight the following day and not two days later When this has happened to me on other airlines they have always provided a hotel room free of charge and tried their best to get me on a flight the very next day regardless of the reason for the cancellation I ultimately had to cancel my return flight and get a rental car to get myself home at an additional cost of several hundred dollars I

43, The day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from Houston to San Diego We noticed the change reduced our layover to minutes so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict We arrived hours before our scheduled time so I stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the over worked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didn t see anything that was better This phrase came up a lot but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they don t have control of the weather etc regarding delays The only flights from Southwest that were delayed were those to San Diego it was not weather related as the flights to and from San Diego were also on schedule except ours After waiting until we could check luggage hrs we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended minute layover Agent told me that she could only find another flight with seat headed to Boise but she could only see Houston connections so I called their number rd agent was an explanation followed by hold hang up th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option but because we checked baggage the only person willing to help us had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from San Diego to Boise has passengers and is going to wait for us I asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection but that would be unfair to everyone else so we sat in the back I knew I was being lied to but at this point I figured I d just wait to see what would happen We fly to San Diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a voucher for a later flight YAY I looked at my pass and it was an A position which was nice and handed off the other for our family to my wife and went in search of food terminal was super crowded due to construction so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit I mentioned how it was nice that we didn t get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was C and his girlfriend was C I took our passes to the th agent was for new passes and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together She immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers I stated that my original tickets were in the A group for that leg of the flight in an irritated voice but she stuck to her argument At this point I was done with their service so I expressed to her that I had spent the better part of hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored She threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor The supervisor and I had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness but she would allow us to board together She mentioned the vouchers but why would I ever fly with them again I d pay not to and told her so She also asked why I didn t ask for a supervisor Isn t that their job when they can t help a customer Flying with Southwest is just not worth the trouble They get a rating because their flight staff is actually amazing ,"[('day', 'n'), ('started',

whole way even through conveyor walk ways while he radioed ahead that there s a woman and two children running your way All I could think about was making this flight As I got closer I heard times Flight to Fort Myers is fully boarded and if you want to make this flight then you need to come now or the door would be permanently locked I was frantic When we got there the gal taking the ticket

60, Allow me to share my recent experience that left me deeply disappointed My boarding pass clearly stated that I needed to be on the plane by PM as the scheduled departure time was PM However due to the disorganized nature of the TSA it took an astonishing minutes for me to place my personal belongings on the tray for scanning To compound the situation the TSA officials encountered difficulties while scanning my daughter s belongings As I anxiously watched the clock it took them an additional minutes to complete the task Finally I arrived at the gate at PM a respectable minutes before the designated boarding time mentioned on my boarding pass To my dismay however the door had already been closed and I along with approximately other passengers who had faced similar delays with TSA were denied boarding Consequently I missed my flight to Ft Lauderdale and had to hastily book a flight to Orlando at PM which landed at PM On top of that I had to endure a tiring hour drive to WPB knowing that I had work the next day As a frequent traveler missing a plane was a first for me and it has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with Southwest again What truly bewilders me is the stark contrast in treatment when delays occur On numerous occasions I have arrived on time only to experience flight delays for various reasons As customers we are expected to accept such inconveniences but the differential treatment when delays happen to us is disheartening Southwest has unequivocally lost my business To add insult to injury I had to personally retrieve my luggage from the Ft Lauderdale

66, I am handicapped in that I have significant arthritis in just about every joint and am years old I asked for a wheelchair when I booked the flight as I always do This time when I arrived at the airport in Philadelphia to return home this was a round trip booking I checked in at the counter and reminded them that I had signed up for a wheelchair She told me to sit down and one would arrive This seemed normal as I have always traveled on Southwest and this was the routine Well I sat there for over half an hour periodically asking a variety of Southwest personnel about the wheelchair They said it was on the way When my plane was scheduled to board in minutes I began to panic When I asked at the desk again the woman said why don t you just walk I was beginning to think that they thought I could walk to the gate and through security and were not going to provide the wheelchair I needed At that point I saw a person with a wheelchair and no one in it I asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she worked for airline and couldn t take southwest passengers Then she said that If I could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me She told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate The plane was boarding It was very clear that had I not approached this person and practically begged her to take me I would have missed my plane my connecting flight and heaven knows when I could have gotten home This would be a disaster for me given my inability to navigate myself anywhere except short distances not to mention what to do with my dogs at home whose sitter had to leave for another job I am disgusted with Southwest and I never thought I would say this but there is no excuse for what was just totally ignoring my disability needs When I called southwest to complain they said they could file a report internally but they were not under an obligation to provide a pusher for a wheelchair in this case there was no wheelchair OR pusher and I know that s not true If they don t want to provide this service it should not be offered when I book the flight Then I would go to another airline Also when the person behind the desk told me to just walk to the gate it was clear that they were not taking my disability seriously and really had no intention of helping me

70, I am quite disappointed with Southwest I and several members of my company have been flying Southwest for the past several years because the service and convenience had been exemplary particularly when taking into account the reasonable pricing I have seen its attributes in many way degrade and some of the competitors improve their standards I was particularly dismayed after having left my briefcase and phone on a flight on May th After filing a lost report soon after deplaning I received no helpful assistance from the airline other than an email three days later stating that they were looking into it and should consider the case close if no further notice had been received withing days Misplacing a phone these days does not only cause a significant financial impact but the information contained may be critical For this reason a more definitive answer than the nonchalant response from Southwest baggage supervisor at Midway Airport stating that they would be drowned in lost items that they receive daily then added things including I Pads phones and other items This statement struck me as particularly irritating since the two individuals at the office were sitting without no apparent task at the time With the concern that she displayed I must conclude that the case is probably lost and that the decision to purchase another phone regardless of cost should be undertaken I would have hoped that they might ask me to text my phone to more quickly identify the fact that they may or may not have it in their procession now at the Alabama location where all the lost items from all the Southwest flights go now many thousands of items per day instead of I will remember the lack of concern from Southwest me and my company employees fly in the future

71, I recently had the misfortune of flying with Southwest Airlines and I must say that my experience was nothing short of a disappointment From the moment I stepped foot onto their plane it was evident that this airline lacks the professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction that one would expect First and foremost Southwest Airlines had no regard for punctuality My flight was delayed once and then they decided to rebook it for an unreasonably early hour in the morning This unexpected change disrupted my entire travel plans and left me feeling exhausted before I even boarded the aircraft It is unacceptable for an airline to make such drastic alterations without a valid reason or proper compensation To make matters worse Southwest s servers seemed to be in a state of disarray Throughout the booking process I encountered multiple technical glitches and slow response times on their website It was frustrating to witness a company of this scale failing to maintain their online infrastructure leading to additional stress and wasted time on my end The flight itself was another disappointing aspect of my experience The plane s condition was subpar Southwest Airlines made a promise to compensate me for the inconvenience caused by their multiple delays and rebooking They specifically mentioned a voucher which I was eagerly looking forward to However even after reaching out to their customer service department I was met with indifference and received no resolution It is disheartening to be on the receiving end of such false promises especially when they have a direct impact on the customer experience In conclusion my experience with Southwest Airlines was marred by their unprofessionalism lack of punctuality technical glitches and broken promises I strongly advise potential travelers to consider alternative options and avoid the frustrations and disappointments that come with flying this airline Southwest Airlines has left a sour taste in my mouth and I can confidently say that I will not be choosing them for any future flights ,"[('recently', 'r'), ('misfortune', 'n'), ('flying', 'v'), ('Southwest', 'n'), ('Airlines', 'n'),

72, In Southwest served million cans of soda juices and water million alcoholic beverages million bags of pretzels million bags of peanuts million snackpacks million other snacks Just think how much money Southwest would save if they stopped offering all those free drinks but then the public would go crazy Our beverage service has been canceled on probably out of the last flights I have been on And no I don t fly the same place so its not likely due to a specific route But if you do the math Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year An average soda costs about for the airlines once you factor in the cost of the drink itself they purchase cans the cup and the ice which isnt much On average a flight has about passengers that s easily they can put in their pocket when they cancel beverage service and that s assuming each passenger only has one drink On a recent flight the one I m on as I write this we were once again denied this freebie service in the name of supposed turbulence despite a relatively smooth flight I ve heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision so I asked When I asked about this instead of simply answering my question letting me know that the captain made the decision etc the flight attendant said something like let me find out A few minutes later the captain came on and explained why he felt it was important to cancel service essentially providing an excuse for why they did this When I asked for the captain s name so i could verify this with SWA customer service I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me were not going to do that and refused to give me his name He also threatened that they would divert the plane although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat not yelling or anything I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear can t have more than one passenger figure out the little secret Although I dont know what they are so worried about Most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience let alone do anything that could actually make a difference like report this on social media or via customer service But still you dont have to hide and refuse to provide your name if you aren t doing anything wrong So this is all being done in the name of safety lets go

84, I had a horrible trip I booked a trip from Oakland Ca to Savannah Ga in Nov I HATE flying early so I booked a flight that had a reasonable late morning departure and paid the extra money for a better schedule About a week before my trip in April of Southwest canceled my flights and rebooked my whole trip So I had to get up at am to be at the airport by am for my new take off time of am Exactly what I didn t want and paid extra to avoid There was no refund for my extra payment when they forced me onto the early undesirable schedule Then On my return home from Savannah our plane was delayed taking off at the Savannah airport It turns out the fuel truck for our plane didn t have enough fuel in it Seriously So they went and got more fuel and then refuelled our plane which caused a delay to our connection in Houston We would have had minutes given the delay for fuelling to catch our flight in Houston but Southwest elected to keep the plane to Oakland on time and leave us behind Great Now we are rebooked through Southwest for a flight the next day and we are in Houston overnight And guess what I have to get on a plane at am which is exactly why I paid extra money for my original schedule to avoid The representative at the Houston airport was really nice Angie G and we got a hotel voucher and a Southwest voucher But this just isn t enough I m arriving hours late I m staying in a city overnight that I don t care to be in and cutting my sleep for the second time in a week to keep a flight schedule that I didn t authorize or sign up for I paid my pet sitter to stay the night in my home and take care of my pets unexpectedly for the extra night Where is the actual compensation for the hours of my life that I spent overnight in Houston I had to eat I had to pay my pet sitter I lost sleep and essentially I lost an entire day of rest at home before my work week This is just awful I don t know what is going on with this airline but I have no interest in your

109, What is going on with SW On a return flight from Puerto Rico to Denver Southwest canceled the second leg of our flight out of Tampa while we re in the air to Tampa citing weather After doing much research and having our local news look into this it appears that only the SW flights were canceled into Denver other airlines were arriving as scheduled The actual statistic for that evening were of SW flights were cancelled into Denver and less than of other airlines were cancelled The FAA did not issue any closures or delays to Denver I can t imagine why weather would be an excuse when no one else was using it After talking to the agents we kept being told that there were no other flights that evening when in reality there were We just weren t offered those flights And yes there was availability according to the website And they weren t canceled We received some of the most unapologetic uncaring and disingenuous treatment from Southwest Airlines across the board From the gate agent to the ticketing agent to the baggage agent to the customer service rep After leaving the airport because our flight was changed to a AM flight the following day I called to inquire again if there were better flights I had to wait ONE to TWO hours just to speak to a live person Our options to return were an early morning flight or an evening flight for a non stop flight There was no way I was going to chance taking a flight with a layover anywhere Southwest is not to be trusted and I didn t want to get into a situation where we were then stranded at yet another airport I don t know what is going on with Southwest and why their business model is falling apart SW used to be my go to airline we even had the credit card but have since retired it due to the airline s inconsistency with flights If SW thinks it s ok to strand passengers in random places just to make their customary playbook profitable then they are not focusing on what is important The local news received a disingenuous reply from a SW rep regarding our situation but also showed some telling facts Many of the flights we proactively canceled at the start of today were in anticipation of operational conditions in Denver Southwest cancelled our flight in the morning and we were not notified until we were in the air on our way to Tampa If we had been notified we would have chosen to stay at our own expense in San Juan to spend more time with our family but we were not given that option Other airlines always lets us know when a flight is going to be delayed or cancelled and they do this in advance and they let us change our flight to a time that works for us SW does not offer this Their system is antiquated and not user friendly We are disgusted with the treatment we received They are

110, I had SWA tickets from ONT to ATL with a connection in Dallas Southwest clearly lost control of their operation on and stranded me in Vegas Ok there was ice in Dallas but I would have been happy to keep my hotel room and car another day to avoid being stranded They kept telling me to come to the airport as they had rescheduled my flight Instead they cancelled my flight FIVE times and promised me each time that I could reach my destination on time I asked if there was any chance of missing my connection and SW said no I think they were fabricating stories because they got me to give up my hotel room rental car One time in ONT they pushed off from the gate and rode around on the runway and then parked right back at the gate It was hot in the plane and full of fumes I got sick on the plane Once parked again I got off the plane and tried to talk to some one ANYONE who could help but there was just one ticket person and a long line of angry customers I never was able to schedule another connection in Ontario At one point they said they would take my luggage off the plane and then said they wouldnt So I got back on the plane prefering to be stranded with luggage rather than without These Southwest people are rude and crude and have no idea what they are telling people Why do they feel they have to tell people things that aren t true Is it just some power trip and they enjoy wrecking the plans of their customers Anyhow I eventually landed in Vegas and once again there was no one who knew what was going on No one could tell me how to get home to Atlanta I had a boarding pass for the flight to Atlanta but when I tried to use it they said the boarding pass was no good Some SWA jerk grabbed it out of my hands and said Hmm it says it s for Atlanta Anyhow they told me to go talk to customer service so I lost my seating assignment At customer service they printed out another ticket and said to go get on the plane I tried and again the boarding pass was not working The whole time they were acting as if this was my fault even though it was their obvious flawed way of doing things Any airline this bad should not be allowed to fly They are completely unsympathetic Just rude and nasty if you express simple concerns about your schedule or luggage In one breath they blame it on flight control tell you what flight to get on and then it all turns out to be bogus information Keep in mind that Southwest perpetuated this mess over three days Maybe somewhere someone was working on it but you could have fooled me They looked like idiots and no one had any confidence in what they were saying Southwest made a lot of people desperate for no reason Ok there was ice in Dallas but Southwest made the situation times worse by telling people their flights

114, My wife and I have been traveling on Southwest for nearly three decades and generally appreciate their service or that they do their best to be helpful when travel plans go sideways In fact we just had a trip through Southwest Vacations that was fantastic Our latest experience with them however has been both eye opening and frustrating We had booked flights for February nd from Puerto Vallarta to Reno with a connection in Phoenix We had flight from Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix and then flight from Phoenix to Reno We received an email from Southwest notifying us that our flights were changed from Puerto Vallarta to Denver and then Denver to Reno We had seen this Denver connection when we were initially booking our trip however we did not want to fly from Mexico to Denver in the dead of the winter Too much of a chance of being stuck in Mexico I went on the Southwest website and could see that our original flights through Phoenix and on to Reno were still there and they were still selling tickets for these flights I called Southwest customer service and asked that our flights be changed back to our original flights The customer service representative changed us back to the original flight Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix but informed us here s where things got wonky that we could no longer choose our original Phoenix to Reno flight because the two flights were no longer linked in their system I asked her what she meant by that Apparently Southwest links certain flights together so when you search for a flight from A to B with a connection in between it will only show you these linked flights There may be other connecting flights that are departing earlier or later depending on your needs but you will not see them because they are not linked flights in their system So our original flights were linked when we booked them but were then unlinked and changed by Southwest to Denver And when I tried to change them back I was told that is no longer an option because those two flights are no longer linked The only linked flight through Phoenix was a hour and minute layover in Phoenix and then a flight stopping in Vegas and traveling on to Reno I pointed out to Southwest that there was an earlier flight through Vegas and on to Reno with only a hour and minute layover I was told that was not an option because that was not a linked flight Seriously You changed our flights You un linked our original flights and refuse to do anything to restore our original flights or alleviate the lengthy delay you left us with C mon Southwest you can do better At the end of most flights the flight attendant will say We know you have a choice in flying and we thank you for flying Southwest And so my wife and I will spend our hour and minute layover contemplating our future travel plans and considering if it s time to exercise that choice ,"[('wife', 'n'), ('traveling', 'v'), ('Southwest', 'n'), ('nearly', 'r'), ('three', None), ('decades', 'n'), ('generally',

woken up Then I had booked a flight home Dec to fly home after life saving surgery to spend Christmas with my family until my flight was canceled twice so I ended up having to spend Christmas alone and lost money due to paid appointments thanks to Southwest I rebooted my flight and requested assistance which was not given after I specifically told them I couldn t lift per Dr Orders but didn t get help until second time where I had to go through security again andI had to pay fora carry on bag I was told I would get a flight credit due to SW canceling my trip because they sent my mom one When I called to ask about it again they told me I don t get one after I had been waiting for the email I was promised I am beyond disgusted as a customer and if the situation is not handled I will not be using SW again and will make sure to tell everyone I know not to use them either They are a dishonest company who doesn t care about their customers or taking care of them as promised I

stopped in Tennessee first I think that was Flt scheduled for PM landing after midnight I took it I will pay the for car service to get to New Hampshire I went downstairs got my bags from the Manchester flt checked them for the Boston Flight Went through security again At that flight cancelled They told me I could rebook for Monday morning flt several stops but you stay on the plane to Boston get in hours later I booked it I was told my bags would be downstairs again I went downstairs was told over over again by the staff downstairs my bags would be down as soon as they could hours later when the baggage doors closed I was told no more bags coming down I could speak to a manager but there were no managers downstairs I could go upstairs I did guess what no manager there either I went home bagless exhausted I asked at least ten time was told the bags will be here There was no real security watching these bags I had the Christmas gifts for my family in one bag all my winter clothes in the other I would have left if I felt they would be secure I wish I had I stayed home Christmas my rd flt was cancelled I tried calling Southwest on hold the first time hours had to hang up then hours on hold then disconnected I went back to the airport on Got on line AM to try again to get a flt to Manchester I was on that line for hours The reason it was so long is that we were not important to Southwest They had sometimes employees at the counter sometime all of the Southwest employees would take the A list people that just walked into there lane that haven t waited more then minutes So basically the group of over to over people were left with sometimes one person who was at the end of the counter to assist them in finding a new flight How disgusting How belittling to treat your customers with such disrespect I finally rebooked now for the last time I m going to try to get to Manchester on Now I go downstairs to get my luggage you know it not happening Its no where to be found so what are my options a line hours later I get into the luggage counter and ask where is my luggage My last flight was flight cancelled yesterday Well the young man says one bag in is Boston one is still in Tampa I didn t go to Boston but my bag got a spot I told him the other bag is not here I looked for it several times He said well it could be on a cart somewhere we don t have the staff to look for it You had the staff to send one of them to Boston Was it an A list bag I asked how do I get my bags He said once you land in Manchester you can request your bags What Now you want me to get in line in another state I know that Boston doesn t fly to Manchester So what you re telling me is they will fly my bags somewhere else then to Manchester Do I get the mileage points or do my bags get them Also by the time my bags get to Manchester if in fact they do find them I will either be in NY or back in Tampa The only warm clothes I own are in one of those bags He said there

and a hotel room unused and non refundable These two stick out but the worst of all is our Christmas flights My husband and I were set to fly to MCO on a non stop and Christmas eve as we try to check in to find I get a seat and he does not SW split us up and put my husband on standby with people in front of him To make matters worse just hours before we have to drive an hour a half to DAL cant get

flight out of San Diego to Chicago trying to get to Washington DC I was assured by the gate agent that I would make my connection from Chicago to DC I missed it by minutes Arrived at MDW in the middle of the night No open restaurants in the airport Took shuttle to expensive hotel not in my budget to say the least No room service Closed for the night No meal vouchers no compensation offered Spent

discussing missing co workers Saying that the delays were weather related let them off the hook for any compensations to abandoned passengers Flight four of four Jam packed terminal in Houston waiting for flight to San Diego Screaming yr old screaming year old same family in terminal waiting for our flight The family three women held these screaming children on their laps in the terminal for an hour never letting them down to walk or run Then on the airplane they sat in the seats behind me I was in the bulkhead seat along side a handicapped man For the duration of the three hour flight the young inexperienced mother did nothing to quiet her children while she read a book She gave them no toys did not talk to them just let them kick the seats in front of them non stop squirt juice onto the head of the handicapped man all the while letting out non stop ear piercing blood curdling screams I have travelled with toddlers before many times I know it can be difficult but this was a parenting issue The flight attendant was just a few feet away so could not miss what was going on The handicapped man asked the flight attendant to intervene multiple times Only twice she spoke gently to the mother who responded They are children What am I supposed to do She was completely unapologetic The flight attendant never spoke in a firm manner with her as she should have I can t help but think that if the screaming kicking person were an adult the plane would have been landed at the nearest airport and an arrest would have occurred with head spinning speed Why is such torture of other passengers tolerated There was a lot that could have been done to alleviate the situation Do children s rights trump adult s rights One of those screaming children did not even pay for a seat as we

189, Santa Ana to Portland via San Jose Our group of persons paid the add on fee of Early Bird for our round trip Our trip down went as booked However Sept we did our online check in hours ahead and had been assigned A early bird boarding for both legs of our returning flights Yesterday Oct we got to the airport to check in only to find out we had been reassigned to C group on first leg and B group on nd leg At this point we still had NO IDEA our entire itinerary had been changed I paid an additional fee to upgrade to A boarding the other in my group kept their C group We were all confused and angry We got down to the gate only to realize we were not even on flight anymore but we were now on a flight to San Jose and our SJC to PDX was also different So we were no longer on our pm flight out of Santa Ana to San Jose We had been moved to a pm flight because we found out our Portland connection flight had been cancelled So because they had changed our itinerary at am on we no longer had A group early bird boarding assigned We were now stuck in C boarding which was why I had been told I had to pay another upgrade fee so that I would still be in A group The agent checking us in never even realized what had happened to us She was very nice but her explanations to us were NOT accurate She never even told us we were no longer on our pm flight As far as I m concerned ALL of this was horrible SW airlines service We were never consulted on any changes or choices that were made for us When we did our initial online check in we were in A group for our original reservation flights When they changed us they did not give us our PrePaid early bird check ins for those new flights In addition in reality they should never have changed our first flight either because we could have just had an extended layover of hours in San Jose but still had our pre assigned A group for that portion I am unhappy and VERY dissatisfied If they are moving flights they need to be sure they can still honor their own early bird boarding on the flights they are moving their customers to I am giving them a very low rating because they did not honor the early bird options that our group of had chosen when we made our original reservations and also PAID for In addition I m giving the ticket agent a rating because while she was a very nice woman she should have been able to figure out and tell us that all these changes had been made Instead I just paid another for something I had already paid additional for early check in and A group boarding ,"[('Santa', 'n'), ('Ana', 'n'),

221, My grandson and I were supposed to leave Juan Santamaria Airport in San Jose Costa Rica en route to Baltimore at p m on Saturday August The flight had six delays and did not depart until after p m The passengers were told that the scheduled pilot had flown too many hours within some specified time and was over FAA regulations Another pilot needed to be found In addition they said there were some problems in Baltimore without specifying what I will note there are a lot of problems in Baltimore It seems completely irresponsible to me that an airline would not keep track of pilot hours flown in order to avoid putting their customer through the situation we experienced Before we boarded we were informed that our flight would not be non stop which is what we paid for The reason given was that be the time we reached Baltimore the customs agents would have quit work for the day We were rerouted through Houston which added another two hours to our total flying time When we arrived in Houston we had to drag our carry ons out of the plane at p m to have them clear customs over three hours after we were to have landed in Baltimore then lug them back onto the plane Our flight finally touched down in Baltimore around a m over eight hours later than the scheduled p m arrival of the previous day At least my grandson and I could go home Many travelers were transferring in Baltimore to other destinations For them the agony of the day only continued I will add that our check in to go to Costa Rica on Saturday August did not go well either The line at the international check in was over one eighth of a mile long I have photos to prove it Southwest did not have sufficient agents to accommodate the customers on the international flights they had booked They were grossly understaffed It was only through the intercession of an agent that my grandson and I were able to make our departing flight Southwest offered the passengers on our returning flight a coupon good for another Southwest flight within the next year Big deal We paid round trip each way If they really wanted to make amends they would have had a rebate commensurate with the frustration they heaped upon their customers When Southwest arrived on the national scene years ago as a regional airline which was expanding I was very impressed They can blame their current problems encountered by me my grandson and all the other customers on COVID not enough employees supply chain issues or whatever other excuses are in vogue these days It is clear to me that this company has devolved to a significant degree They have lost the customer orientation they once had Not being able to add the hours a pilot flies and not being able to compute how many check in people are needed for the departing flights are issues of poor management Very poor I will be looking for other carriers for my future trips to Costa Rica and suggest to all who read this not to fly Southwest until such time that they give evidence of better management like being able to add and divide ,"[('grandson', 'n'), ('supposed', 'v'), ('leave', 'v'), ('Juan', 'n'), ('Santamaria', 'n'), ('Airport', 'n'), ('San',

236, Atlanta to La Guardia On Monday July th my daughter and I were returning home from Atlanta to NYC LaGuardia via Southwest Airlines First time ever using them We arrive at the airport at AM for a AM flight After going through TSA and sitting at the gate for a while our flight was cancelled with no announcement or warning My daughter happened to look up and see on the gate TV screen the words CANCELLED The gate personnel were gone and I was left to calm my daughter s nerves because she has never experienced this before calm my own nerves as I suffered from severe anxiety and my meds were in my checked bag and try to figure out what to do next Keep in mind I booked the early morning flight because I had to be home by am to take over the babysitting duties of my two other children so that my wife could go to work So that was my first thing to address finding last minute child care I then get an email confirming that my flight was indeed cancelled no explanation as to why and I was put on the PM plane to LGA later that night So now the next steps were to find out what happened to our checked bags and what to do for hours till my flight with pretty much no money left for my daughter and I to find a hotel I mean we re taking a low budget airline I m a stay at home dad living on my wife s income Go figure hours later with our bags in NY before we are even on a plane we get to the departing gate for our rescheduled pm flight and of course it s DELAYED pm is the new departure time Then it s pushed back to PM Once on the plane only water and a snack was offered to us soda coffee and alcohol were no longer an option Once at LaGuardia we then had to find our checked bags My pre arranged airport pick up no longer available The line for a taxi extremely long My daughter and I jumped on a city bus to take us to Manhattan so that we could take a taxi to the Bronx dollars I couldn t afford to spend charged to my credit card Long story short got to the airport at AM and after an anxiety inducing day afternoon my daughter and I get home at am in the morning Fast forward to today I call Southwest customer service to get an explanation and find out how Southwest can make things right for me so that I can continue using them in the future again this was my first ever experience with them The agent informed me that the first flight was canceled due to weather and that the rescheduled flight was delayed due to air traffic control issues so we were not entitled to compensation I never once said on the call I wanted to be compensated so that was quite an assumption and was then told after reiterating everything I went through would you have preferred that we put you on an unsafe flight I mean WOW What a great condescending customer service response To the Southwest rep that hopefully reads this and yes I will be posting this on MULTIPLE review sites and social media I shall NEVER fly Southwest again and will voice my displeasure to anyone who asks me about my experience with Southwest PS My family and I had an issue with JetBlue a few years ago and their customer service was the TOTAL OPPOSITE of what I experienced with Southwest Very warm

had already looked up possible flight schedules I thought this would be a quick hold as there were very few possibilities After minutes on hold I was hung up on Now I have to call back This time it only took minutes to get a human so I should consider myself lucky right I explained everything over again and apologized if I sounded irate which I was This time I just told the woman which flight I wanted I then inquired about what she could do to make me feel better about flying Southwest ever again in the future I suggested a simple upgrade to A on my boarding pass to get me on the plane earlier so I might get a window seat This would have cost the airline nothing and would have made me feel like they were actually sorry about my being quite inconvenienced She said she couldn t do that but could give me a discount on my next flight which would cost them I told her I didn t want a coupon for a flight I might never take and she asked if I d like to speak to someone about it I said that I would like to speak with a supervisor and was about to insist on not being put on hold when I was put on hold I m not one to give up easily so I waited on hold for an hour and a half before I was forced to hang up because I had to leave home for my new flight at am and it was almost pm Now I m going to be late for an appointment at my destination and get only hours of sleep I have

intentionally dismantled to make it fit smoother under the plane I went to the ticket counter where Diane and a manager both told me they do not cover damages only losses They filled out a report and said I can try to talk to customer service to see if they will replace it I was sent home with no replacement and no check to replace my infant s stroller Quickly forward to I flew from St Louis back to Charlotte again only to have my car seat that I checked in not put on the plane Once again Diane was at the ticket counter and gave me a loaner car seat However my car seat was also in a travel bag

331, Shame on Southwest Airlines My husband and I and our family have used Southwest for over years This past March we were supposed to leave Portland Maine at in the morning and we received a cancellation for no reason on March at PM in the evening We could not get through to the site via Internet or phone on how to reschedule a new flight Since we had reservations for two weeks in Orlando all paid for we needed to get on a flight as soon as possible So my husband tried and tried and waited on hold for almost an hour before he finally just gave up and decided to book a different flight and the only one we could fly find was from Boston which is a Hour Drive instead of a min drive to Portland The only flight we could find was for leaving Boston that morning which meant we had to leave Portland Maine by AM We did not sleep at all that night On top of that the flight that was connecting was delayed as well The real kicker is that because we did not follow Southwest Airlines rules for rescheduling a canceled flight we had to pay more to drive two hours longer to get to the airport to actually get on a flight And the person who answered our phone call later on was like oh well too bad you didn t do it the way you were supposed to I just don t understand how a an airline can cancel the flight out of the blue for no reason and not assist their travelers and then along the way the attendants were rude and obnoxious and in no way helpful or kind We are still trying to figure out how we can get refunded our money over something that we did not do we did not cancel the flight Southwest airlines canceled the flight They should honor the fact that we had booked our flights months ahead of time And they should do a better job when canceling a flight to assist customers

335, My husband had been an A List member of Southwest Airlines for over years He traveled extensively for his work and we always appreciated the special perk he received of priority boarding due to his status When Covid hit and all airlines came to a halt his company put a moratorium on all travel even after the airlines were back up and running Last fall he received a promotion from Southwest that if he traveled one round trip flight anywhere he could retain his A List status Unfortunately he had been diagnosed with cancer back in the spring of and began undergoing cyberknife treatments in September His doctors specifically told him he should not travel through the remainder of the year as he was immunocompromised We contacted Southwest and let them know the situation The agent with whom I spoke advised that if we could provide a certification from his oncologist they would consider our request to extend his status despite the fact he was unable to travel even the bare minimum in Yesterday after going through a second appeal process following an initial denial of our request from Southwest we were told they would not be able to honor our request I am absolutely appalled that

were met with sour looks wrong information it turned out and I have MS and although I don t appear disabled I walk with great difficulty My husband was with me We needed a wheelchair There were no pushers at all and we were treated like it was too much to ask or expect We weren t blaming Southwest about the wheelchairs but that is who we had to ask for it But that wasn t a main issue The desk agents in arranging our new flights treated us like scum under his feet he made mistakes instead of answering our questions he said You re done so move away My husband was trying to push my wheelchair I was rolling my carry on beside me my tote on my lap my husbands back pack We had been stuck in Phoenix nights due to weather We were smiling respectful polite and understanding on purpose It didn t help He again told us to get out of the way quickly In days back at the airport after our new flight didn t show on the APP waiting on hold hours never receiving the previously requested call back Finally we got an email with the flight confirmation The desk agent had no one else in line and couldn t find us in the computer My husband looked up the email with the confirmation to show her and she rudely said I don t want to see any phones Don t show me papers we hadn t You aren t booked We were but somehow she couldn t find us until she tried for over minutes Not sure if it was system or human problem Ok so no wheelchair pushers on duty so that was a wreck I m pushing carryons beside my wheelchair husband is carrying items plus pushing We get to security No help at all An agent said we needed a pusher and to go to the information desk and ask them to call for a pusher through security The info man said I don t know who told you that but I don t do that So security was a mess I can t walk or stand long enough I needed to stay in my chair I was greeted with sour looks and impatience when they asked if I could try to walk through the scanner I can t And I can t help my disease

352, Within my four flights to and from NM there has been a total of hours worth of delays waiting Our first flight we were going to NM from Maine and due to a technical error my name was misspelled and it took staff a very long time both times to fix the name on the boarding pass but I don t blame the staff I blame the system that Southwest uses We were already there two hours early so we had time to do the things we needed to do before boarding but Southwest Airlines will be giving you so much time that you won t know what to do with yourself We were told that the very first delay was due to the plane being too heavy because of passengers baggage and fuel After they sorted that out we were finally on our way After we landed for our connecting flight in Baltimore we waited an hour on the pavement to get to a terminal because all of them were full Once we finally got to a terminal in Baltimore we had to haul butt to the other side of the Airport because our connecting flight was going to be missed no thanks to Southwest This being my first time flying I decided not to let it bother me too much However now that we are flying back and dealing with the same extensive delays and terrible customer reimbursement of funds and services I decided it might be time to give a cent I d like to note that all the staff have been so helpful and wonderful this whole time the flight attendants and pilots have been extremely kind and apologetic for this airlines absurd behavior and policies Right now it s pm in Baltimore and our flight was supposed to leave at pm We were already delayed minutes and as soon as passengers started lining up to get on the delayed plane someone on the intercom stated that suddenly the plane is unsafe to travel in and therefore have cancelled that flight They ended up keeping us in the dark for a while until we were told to move to Terminal B instead of B We re awaiting the plane to leave that s currently there so that a new plane can pull up However I m expecting at least an hour more of waiting because they will need to fuel pack and board the plane Overall I ll give a star rating to your very helpful kind and patient staff I ll give a star rating to everything else We were in the dark the whole time and it was made very clear to us that if the airline messed up it was on us Southwest even over boards the planes for profit with no guarantee of a seat So if it s overpacked and there isn t a seat for you someone is expected to voluntarily give up their seat And if they don t I think they ll try to find another plane for you but I m not sure either way what we re they thinking You don t board a plane without plans They don t care as long as they get that ,"[('Within', None), ('four', None), ('flights', 'n'), ('NM', 'n'),

canceled at least minutes prior to travel and travel is completed by the expiration date We are hopeful you will be able to travel with us soon We know you have a choice when you fly and we hope you

459, I have liked flying Southwest until this trip Our first suitcase came out open yes unzipped along with many others where you could see the clothing inside and ours was also cut in an L shape I left my husband and daughter while I went to file a claim No one was in the baggage service area and when I went to enter to call out another SW employee told me not to enter Showed this SW employee my issue and she told me to wait the lady would know I was there I asked how she would know as this person had not notified anyone there was no doorbell or cameras She replied the lady would just know A psychic I guess While waiting my daughter called hysterical as her lacrosse sticks had not come out with her teammates and the conveyor belt had stopped When we found it that person was rude as well and stated all sticks come out at over sized baggage and we should have known that Guess they forgot to tell our team as all the rest of the lacrosse sticks in lacrosse stick bags like hers did and have never before or again come out in over sized baggage Hers was the only stick bag to come out at over sized luggage and only that one time When the baggage service lady finally showed up the two SW employees had to converse first about how I was waiting and not happy making me wait even longer When she did finally come over she refused not once but several times to fill out a ticket on my issue She said open and cut luggage was not a valid claim She outright refused to do anything It gets better folks I called SW and was being on hold a very long time Finally someone gets on the phone listens to my issues and than proceeded to tell me the people were not SW employees but employees of BWI and I had to make a claim with BWI When I pointed out all the employees I was calling about all wore SW uniforms she proceeded to enter my complaint about their rude customer service but told me I had to do my own for the luggage I did per her instructions SW responded to the rude complainant with a letter stating they were sorry I was inconvenienced with a delay in my flight and offered me a SW credit The luggage complaint they noted as complete without any letter conversation funds for

460, I trusted Southwest until a flight from Love Field to BWI September arriving PM Within five minutes of deplaning I realized I had left my phone on the plane Unfortunately I had left the secure area so I could not return to Gate A where the plane was located I was directed by Southwest personnel to go to the baggage claim office to receive assistance The three workers at baggage claim were admittedly dealing with a disgruntled employee and stated they could not help me at the time because they were too busy In fact the supervisor reprimanded me for leaving the phone on the plane and claimed it was my own fault for being so stupid Despite resistance I insisted that a missing item claim be filed at the office before I departed the airport I waited at baggage claim until AM when an employee reportedly searched the plane only to find no cell phone When I obtained access to my computer at AM that morning I searched FIND MY PHONE to discover my phone located at the Southwest baggage claim I returned to the Southwest baggage claim the next morning and I showed them on my computer where my phone was located according to FIND MY PHONE They told me they did not have my phone and that they could not help me I then went to the police They accompanied me to the SOUTHWEST baggage claim He told me to stay outside the office and push my phone to ring on the FIND MY PHONE app which I did The police came out of the office and told me that my phone was in the office When I went into the office to get my phone one employee verbally attacked me with comments such as you were the irresponsible one who lost your phone Furthermore they justified themselves that their job was baggage claim not lost and found They would not verify to me where or when the phone had been found

481, Over the past year and half my husband and I have flown many times on Southwest and prior to the Covid pandemic Southwest was always our airline of choice for domestic flights The pandemic changed things quite understandably and we have had patience in what we know has been a difficult situation However the past several flights we have completed with Southwest have definitely taken turns for the worst in terms of customer service with flights being rescheduled without notification to us re routing us to flights that are not non stop when our originally booked flights were nonstop returning us to our home town in the middle of the night when our originally purchased itinerary arrived late afternoon losing our luggage etc But this is finally the last straw We will not be flying Southwest again In June my mother passed away The memorial service is scheduled to take place on August th In July as soon as the memorial service dates were confirmed we booked our flights back to Portland from Colorado for the memorial service Twenty four hours before our flight time we checked in as is the usual routine with Southwest We were assigned seats Some hours later we received the usual emails with reminders for timeliness of arrival to the airport for our flight mask requirements etc Now less than hours prior to our flight departure time we checked our flight status to give my family final updates for our arrival time only to find that Southwest has canceled our flight All other flights from Denver to Portland within the next hours are listed by Southwest as Unavailable We called the Contact Us number for Southwest Airlines to try to figure out what we could do to rectify the situation After sitting on hold for literally hours with what became an increasingly annoying message about how sorry Southwest was for the delay and that they would be right with us as soon as possible we finally gave up and hung up While sitting on hold we found and booked a flight on a different airline at last minute prices with luggage fees etc This behavior by Southwest Airlines is profoundly unprofessional and completely unacceptable It breaches the contract Southwest Airlines entered into with us as its passengers of a service they were to provide transportation from Colorado to Oregon paid for in advance with the express understanding that the service would in fact be provided At the very least timely notice of the inability to provide the service should have been provided along with an explanation as to why the service was canceled at the last minute with literally no notice to us of the cancellation No offer of restitution or alternative transportation has been made and Southwest has refused to provide any sort of customer service although I m sure that no one could be paid enough to have to deal with customers treated in such a fashion by their employer After going on line and reading recent Washington Post among others articles we now see that Southwest has been doing this to its customers for the past several months They certainly won t be doing it for very much longer because they will be out of business soon You cannot treat your customers like this and expect to continue to have any In a customer service oriented business such as the passenger airlines are the death knell for Southwest Airlines is surely tolling

484, Pre pandemic I was always flying Southwest with my family I loved the free bags and no extra fees I always had great customer service too I used to recommend Southwest to everyone Well let me tell you no more Their service quality and customer care has gone down the drain I finally got to visit my family this summer after a year and a half of not seeing most of them due to the pandemic Myself and my three boys traveled to our destination via American Airlines Had no issues there great service and a nice plane On the way back however I traveled via Southwest Unbeknownst to me they had changed my nonstop flight to a flight with one stop in Orlando I found this out when checking on my flight a few days before Now in their defense I searched my email and they had notified me of this change back in the beginning of May via an email that I am fairly certain ended up in my promotions folder instead of my inbox or else I would have seen it The thing that urked me is that they made this change the day after I bought my nonstop tickets The day after their sale ended they decided to get rid of a bunch of nonstop flights How convenient for them Not so much all of us who booked with them because we wanted a nonstop flight I was hoping they had one this week that I could change it to but nope Checked their website none Now mind you I was traveling alone with three boys My oldest is and the other two are both under the age of a month old and a month old If you are a parent you understand how difficult this could be I waited on hold for almost hours just for them to tell me they could refund my tickets but if I used flight credit it would stay as flight credit not helpful as they have no nonstop flights on this route anymore They said they temporarily got rid of nonstop flights from their schedule I looked at my options for the week and either the layovers were way too short to make it to the other plane for us or they were long and required even more flight time Needless to say I had to keep my flight By then other airlines were too expensive and Southwest said they could not book us on another airline I was told this before I even asked so you know a bunch of people must have asked this I haven t gotten to the worst part yet We had a fine first flight to Orlando A little over two hours They kept changing the time but ended up boarding on time after all We made it to Orlando and our stroller was already waiting for us when we got off the plane Kudos to Orlando people Flying to Dallas was a different story We were sitting in the plane an hour before we took off This was due to the weather so that I understand This was another and a half hour flight as well My poor kids were doing fairly well despite traveling all day Remember two of them are a young toddler and a baby Near the end of the flight while we had been traveling for over hours already one of the flight attendants remarks about the mess we had made my toddler spilled some chip crumbs on the floor and said that we would have to clean it up but she said it in a passive aggressive way and asked if we needed ,"[('Pre', 'n'), ('pandemic', 'a'), ('always', 'r'),

486, I flew southwest months pregnant with my husband year old son and year old daughter returning home to Orlando from Portland Oregon after coming from my mother passing away on Our flight was scheduled to leave Portland at pm which was only delayed minutes no big deal The lay over was in Denver we get off the plane with minutes to spare before our connecting flight was suppose to take off to find out our flight had been canceled and was not leaving until am the next morning We are then told to go wait in the customer service line for minutes to get told we can t have a partial refund hotels would not be accommodated and the flight in the morning would be taking us to Indianapolis then Orlando instead of our original flight which was straight from Denver to Orlando The customer service representative cut me off and stated that they only had spots on this plane so I needed to tell her if I wanted to be on the plane or not They told us the flights were canceled due to weather but there was no bad weather in Denver or Orlando My family and I went to the rd floor sat in seats and walked my year old around in the stroller until she fell asleep for exactly hour no one else slept at all We were able to leave at am with a flight going straight to Orlando I got sick from lack of sleep literally the morning of before we got on the plane my daughter husband and son are all sick now but thankfully we made it home the next day by pm I think it s highly unprofessional to drastically change someone s flight to the next day when they land and then try and make them pay for a

491, My family and I bought Southwest tickets to fly to Mexico in December for my th birthday Prior to flying my father contracted COVID and was also diagnosed with dementia The hotels also put COVID restrictions into place We called Southwest and cancelled our flights to which we were given Travel Funds Fast forward we are taking the family and going on a vacation in December this year We tried to book the flights using our travel funds and were told we can not due to them expiring in October We called customer service and explained the situation and were rudely told we have to wait until they expire and then pay a per ticket fee to reinstate them We understand paying the fee and requested to pay it now to extend the date We explained we can not wait until October to book the flights as flights are limited and are already nearly sold out The customer service rep had zero compassion and stated there was nothing she could do that that was the policy We asked to speak to a supervisor and were told only contact with them was through email The email response we received only had a first name and stated there was absolutely nothing that could be done to try and resolve the problem We called customer service again and once again explained the situation We again said we would gladly pay the fee now and book the flights The rep sternly responded that they are not able or willing to do anything to assist That we would have to take our chances and wait until after October IF they decide to take the fee and extend the funds or just lose all the money They stated they gave year extensions for travel plans changed due to covid she then sarcastically stated that we did not fall in that time frame COVID is out of our control along with the medical problems of my father We are

496, Back in the day Southwest was the best airline to fly domestically in the states I do not know what happened This last trip has been the worst flight experience I have ever encountered To start my trip I booked my flights with a longer hour layover to ensure a slight delay would not hinder my travel This still was not the case Southwest changed the gate and plane in Norfolk resulting in a delay Next we boarded and waited for over an hour to just get gas in the plane Meanwhile planes scheduled after mine were boarding and taking off in the original gate my flight was supposed to be Almost hours later we took off I knew I was cutting my layover short at that point but we were scheduled to arrive with just enough time to spare I sprinted to my gate to see my next flight s plane sitting there The ramp to get on was still connected to the airplane but no one was there to check me in I frantically looked around for someone to help me but no one was in the area I had to watch my plane leave without me I then got a text stating they had rescheduled me to the next day in the evening I went and talked to a Southwest representative who helped change my flight to earlier in the day but would not offer any other flights to the surrounding airports in LA for the evening I requested they compensate and put me in a hotel as I now had to stay overnight I was informed that they would not put me in a hotel because they were not responsible for me missing my flight They blamed the flight control in Norfolk instead of taking responsibility for being very unorganized resulting in people missing their flight to Ontario there were many more traveling to other places I talked to another representative to see if I could get a better boarding position as I had the boarding position B prior to them sending my plane off They had given me C which is considerably worse They would still not compensate me at all I have been unable to talk to a customer service representative but if this is how Southwest treats their customers now I will not be back I did my research during the extra time I had of sitting in the airport overnight and apparently Southwest has the highest delayed flights percentage Two years ago this was unheard of Their motto of flying the friendly skies does not uphold Its a real shame how far this flight company has fallen ,"[('Back', 'r'), ('day',

539, To say my last experience with Southwest was a disaster would be an understatement It all started from day one to the very end Beyond disappointed To start my flight to Long Island was supposed to be Friday at am out of San Antonio TX I made sure to check in exactly hours prior as I always have and got my confirmation and boarding pass Then that very same night the day before I m supposed to leave I get an email from Southwest saying my flight has been changed to the following day more than hours later than my flight due to a disruption in my itinerary So while I m panicking because I needed to be in Long Island by Friday not Saturday I decided I was going to just show up and play dumb So I did Once I arrived there I had to talk with the customer service team due to receiving an error at the ticketing kiosk because they changed my flight of course I was asked Umm did you change your flight Yes yes I did and just decided to show up a day prior Not So I very politely said No I had not They accommodated thank goodness but I had to fly out an hour later than expected Okay whatever fine Then comes the following Tuesday I had this feeling in the pit of my stomach just knowing something bad was going to happen First off my flight from Long Island to Orlando got delayed two hours due to computers going down and there being nothing they can do Once I got on the plane they then had us sit on the plane for minutes because the plane is too heavy and they were trying to figure out numbers Okay great Now I m starting to panic Not to mention while all of these delays are happening I m terrified I m going to miss my other flights I was originally supposed to be home at approximately pm but due to all of the changes and issues I got home close to am the next day Another flight told us that they didn t have any flight attendants for the flight and it too got delayed another few hours Just beyond livid with the way everything was handled And not to mention since I got back to the San Antonio airport the next day at am I got charged more for parking my car there an extra day I just do not recommend using them going forward They do not have anything in order and everything was in complete disarray I will be using United or Delta going forward because even as one of the flight attendants said to a plane full of upset people and I quote at least they United

booked the flight because we didn t need to change planes Got to Long Beach where we waited for the passengers to board when an announcement was made that the plane is being terminated which meant they were using it to take passengers somewhere else due to all the canceled flights from the technological issues of the day Flight crew told us to get off the plane While waiting in line to find out what was going on I noticed the flight crew lining up to get on another plane right next to our plane and I asked them if they were going to Denver and they all confirmed they were Southwest decided to board a plane right next to our plane that was supposed to continue to Denver with a full group of people and did not allow us to board In other words they backhandedly gave our seats away boarded the crew but not us as we waited on line and took off without us Of course when we finally got to an agent she was showing us on the flight that we should have been on and had a challenge rerouting us for a flight and another hour wait Attached is my ticket which appears we left at like we were supposed to I also included the new ticket which of course was delayed Our seats were given away right

570, I have only flown twice in my whole life My first experience was with Delta Air Lines and it was amazing My second experience flying with Southwest Airlines was absolutely horrible Seating is at a first come first serve basis Therefore if you check in super early you are guaranteed better seating Well I checked into my returning flight about hours before my flight and was still put in the C category meaning that your one of the last groups of people to board Not wanting to be the last group to board me and my fianc paid per person a total of to get a boarding pass in the A group A and A Pittsburgh was to board at gate C While sitting there waiting to board our plane an announcement was made that all of the sudden Pittsburgh was to board at gate C So everyone on that flight ran over to gate C When we got there to board about passengers were already on the flight and the guy boarding the plane said oh you probably won t get to sit together since there s so many passengers on already We said ok well we paid for us to be in group A so we could sit together In return he said I made the announcement a few times in hours Ok well if that were in fact true then everyone else would have heard him as well I m completely dissatisfied and disappointed with this airline I will never use them to fly again Your better off going somewhere elsewhere where they have assigned seating and can help you out not ruin your whole trip We should get reimbursed for the extra money spent since we paid and did not get what we had paid for After landing in Pittsburgh at our destination we approached the attendant asking what we could do to get our money back for our upgraded seats and her response was The tickets are non refundable sorry So we then asked if there s someone we can call about the issue and she said You can call but you still won t get your money back Seriously after paying over a thousand dollars for the flights already then another on top of that

581, I have to share because I am so upset Our family has flown Southwest for years and will never fly them again We called the airlines twice to verify the mask exemption policy for my grandson who just turned After lengthy hours of hold times we were told by separate employees that we were to bring our doctors excuse and the exemption form from their website to the airport that day After hearing the most recent horror stories on the news regarding them we called again this Sunday night We were disconnected after a hour wait Then we waited on hold another two hours to be given totally different information This lady was telling us the excuse and exemption form needed emailed in at least days in advance We were already at day I asked if a supervisor could call me since this is totally different information than we were given and was told that I could get back in line and wait for one Monday morning my daughter waited on hold two hours got a supervisor and was disconnected just as she started to speak She waited another minutes and was given the information of where to send in the info She sent it in and received a receipt by email stating that they would let her know in days She called to address this and was given a number to call today and she was told to press option five When she called the number today there was no option five She left a message somewhere they eventually called her back to tell her that he would ve been approved for not wearing a mask but because it wasn t seven days ahead of time it wouldn t be considered We confirmed by actually speaking to separate representatives their policy and procedure prior to purchasing tickets which was inaccurate we followed every direction they gave us This was their mistake They couldn t of cared less what we we were told Southwest Airlines is the most disorganized mess Such poor customer service doesn t belong in business And it s ridiculous that anyone under wear a mask anyway In researching

592, I ve previously written about four negative experiences that I had in a row flying on SWA I still had a small travel voucher that I didn t want to go to waste so I decided to use it My experience was average I suppose While I ve also written generally glowing reviews about SLC airport the SWA check in staff at SWA were blas Not rude not mean but also not remotely interested acting or helpful Just robotic I even get more helpful service on United relatively speaking and that says something Same for the SWA gate staff As for flight staff the flight attendants were a mix of very cheery and upbeat almost scarily so or yeah blas and even kind of bossy to and barking orders at passengers Not very helpful At least the FA I had to interact with for the most part was the cheery and upbeat one Once at Houston Hobby it took almost minutes to retrieve checked baggage from the carousel while this may be more of a Hobby airport personnel problem this is a problem that Southwest needs to address with airport management as the airport is an airline hub On the bright side the plane was almost spanking new and very clean The snack and Coke served were delicious The plane was only about half occupied though I don t know whether that has to do with bookings and demand or with the fact that we re still in a pandemic Social distancing was possible and enforced as a result Overall summary at least this flight experience on SWA was average rather than hostile so I guess that s an improvement for this airline I still wouldn t recommend as it will take many more average or above average flights with them to convince me that they re not actually the worst airline in the USA and I m far more willing to fly on Delta or Alaska normally anyway for domestic flights ,"[('previously', 'r'),

lungs because of the mask I had put on him We take off and we re in the air and I see about people get up to use the bathroom As soon as I get up with my daughter thinking it was a good time to change her the flight attendant talks on the intercom and tells everyone to stay sitting until the seat belt lights are off I was so angry at this point because they never said anything up until I stood up to finally go and change her diaper These workers were rude and were not pleasant to my kids and I They were very disrespectful in the looks they were giving my kids and I and we re very passive

614, Flight Southwest Airlines January scheduled to depart Denver airport at PM The flight did take off and land safely at the destination BWI airport My checked bag arrived as it should There is nothing else I have to write that is a positive comment about the way this flight was handled First of all many of the passengers were not wearing their masks as required in the waiting area before boarding the flight Some of the same passengers at least by my count boarded the plane without their masks covering their mouths and noses They walked in this manner by the Southwest flight attendants and were not stopped or directed to comply with the rules A lady and an Asian man seated themselves in seats b and c They began taking about liberty and their freedoms and would not wear their masks Seats d e and f had passengers that would not wear their masks properly and they began discussing liberty and freedom loudly The spoke to a passenger nearby that indicated they should comply with the rules since we have a global pandemic Those passengers commented that their is no pandemic and the new media has promoted a hoax All of the sickness is a hoax including the media the drug companies and the liberal media It is difficult for a crew to control morons The crew did have several opportunities to not allow these individuals on the plane to begin with If they will not comply in the boarding area then they must not be allowed to board Other passengers and I purchased our tickets to fly based upon the contract and trust that Southwest would not allow passengers on the plane if they would not comply For the first minutes the Captain and the First Officer did not turn on condition air to save Southwest money Once security removed the lady that was ranting denigrating the flight attendants and other passengers the Captain and First Officer did get the air conditioning going The flight remained at gate C for another hour as the crew sorted the mess Several passengers never wore their masks properly I do not want to get COVID and you do not either Southwest executives must believe times are normal and have forgotten the raging pandemic The boarding process jammed people next to each other in the name of loading quickly The lineup of passengers in the aisle was jammed with many passengers in contact with each other The paln had few empty seats Wake up airline executives you have lost me as a customer until the pandemic is over I do not recommend flying any commercial fight until the airline executives from ever airline realize they must take a loss for the time and hold planes to a capacity until the pandemic is over Passenger safety should be the most important goal of any airline Getting sick with the possibility of death from the illness is a definite threat If you can charter a plane or have your own plane these issues will not affect you Commoners like me will drive of find another way to get safely to any destination I must go to for work Otherwise I am following the Governor s orders and minimizing any travel and recommend that to everyone There is no reason not to wear a mask I tried Southwest and you failed me I would like to think I can fly safely but after this flight I will not be flying on any airline for a long time I felt as if I was in jail Adapt Southwest you must keep us safe ,"[('Flight', 'n'), ('Southwest',

615, On January rd I arrived to ORF with checked bags a book bag personal item and early bird seating We were off to Nashville around with dense fog noted Soon minutes after takeoff it seemed like we were not ascending as usual The cabin became unusually hot and there was an awful plastic metal smell with some vibrations that I thought was just turbulence The captain came overhead to inform us we had struck a flock of birds and we were returning to Norfolk to service the engine The next minutes were terrifying as we glided back down to safety and I applaud the flight crew for returning us safely however the next few events following this incident is where I have some issues with southwest I have always enjoyed flying with southwest airlines and I am an easy customer to please I frequently travel and understand that there are some circumstances that flight crews and airport personnel can not control However I found the way that Southwest dealt with the situation was despicable and disrespectful A simple phone call to follow up after a terrifying incident would have sufficed However I want to acknowledge how great the employees were at the gate dealing with the rescheduling issue and the flight crew unless they failed to report it We all exited the plane and were asked to wait in the terminal Everyone was confused and no one was sharing information and there was only person to help direct all of us on what to do next she was awesome thus the star ground rating The flight was canceled and I was pleased that SW attempted to reschedule me to get to my final destination to MKE Nashville was my connection I ended up asking to change the one they rescheduled Orf to orlando to MKE and flew directly to Chicago and drove up to Mke from there So never heard word from southwest about the incident do I get money back I know that direct to Chicago was cheaper And I didn t get my early bird status I checked the FAA bird strike database not even reported I hope they actually inspected serviced that airbus The next day I was happy because I called and asked where my checked bags were and the very helpful lady informed me that she would make sure they made it to MKE from Nashville I m glad those people who waited for that rescheduled flight got to go and SW called me when my bags were ready to be picked up But all in all I am super salty that our plane hit birds and had to turn around and was not once addressed by the airline No We are sorry you experienced that no flight coupon for my early bird I mean if I wanted to be treated that way they

622, I must share my recent experience I love flying Southwest the employees are fun and accommodating but this year which has been a tough year for the whole world and to top it off as an active military family we were recently put on orders to move out of state making this year even more emotional and scary having to travel Well while flying out of Ontario CA On my husband son and I were waiting to board and as usual Southwest has always treated military greatly so we wait for A listers and group A to board usually small children and active duty is called next to board but we understand that doesn t happen every time everywhere well my husband approached the operations employee and kindly in a soft low tone asked do you allow military to board early here Well a simple sorry sir no would of sufficed but he just gave the most annoyed attitude tone and said No we don t and you can go read online if you want he didn t even allow my husband to finish his sentence and he was extremely rude Wait You think that s all oh no we waited for our group and number to walk up and he looked at my husband and said wait let me check that it really is your turn he didn t want to let us on the plane until he made sure he verified all three of our tickets as if we were too incompetent to read the big letter and number on the boarding pass I could feel and sense his anger and annoyed mood towards us with just his stare I m not one to give reviews much but this really bothered my heart and mind A smile and a positive attitude can make a huge difference in a person but not bigger than a negative attitude and a frown Flight out of Ontario I will forever remember your rudeness and lack of care toward the military member my husband that has volunteered to serve so that your family doesn t have to be drafted so that all that freedom you have is possible and so that your personal family can feel safe We do not expect special privileges but we do expect common respect

623, At the point of boarding the plane I was verbally accosted by the gate agent who rudely embarrassed me by loudly stating I had too many carry on items to board the plane and that I needed to go over there and check something I politely tried to tell the woman that I had a bag with food for the flight and a fleece jacket in it Didn t matter I was accused of having a fanny pack when I was wearing a waist belt in lieu of carrying a purse I had a mini backpack with chargers that per Southwest are not supposed to be checked in baggage and a small suitcase I was not given an opportunity to combine anything I do not consider a waist belt which I was wearing and is similar to a money belt or passport belt to be a carry on item It takes up no more space on my body than a belt on my pants I never remove the waist belt and it does not impede sitting in a single seat or fastening my seatbelt I do not consider food that I was going to eat in flight especially as I was taking an antibiotic at that time for a GI condition to be a carry on item There were many many other passengers who were carrying food on the plane in addition to other carry on items I have never heard of a coat jacket being considered as a carry on item When I left Phoenix it was almost degrees When I arrived in Detroit hours later the temperature was about To say a jacket coat was necessary is an understatement The gate agent was incredibly and unnecessarily rude I was embarrassed unnecessarily in front of other passengers waiting to board I have GI issues and cannot eat anything that might have been served in flight Taking my own food on a hour flight did not seem unreasonable The mini backpack I had is about the size of an ordinary shoe box Had I been given the chance I would have combined items except the waist belt but I was denied that opportunity I submitted a complaint to Southwest post flight and received an email that in essence blamed me for having so many carry on items quoted a number of Southwest policies on baggage as if I do not know how to read and more importantly failed to provide what I consider to be a sincere apology or any language about the gate agent receiving any kind of coaching reprimand or training to correct her inappropriate behavior In other words it was all my fault I am not ok with that I have flown Southwest many times in the past and never had this kind of experience I hope to never fly Southwest again Public humiliation is uncalled for period Not being given a chance to fix my mistake and being ordered around rudely and loudly like a bad child is

725, I had the worst experience ever with South West airlines Houston I waited at baggage claim for over minutes for my bag which never came while over the speaker the announcer called for the owner of a crown royal bag As you may know Crown Royal is a liquor that comes in a purple and gold bag but this couldn t be my bag even though it was purple and gold it clearly said Betsy Johnson all over it I guess that was a funny joke for the employees to yell on the loud speaker that owner of a crown royal bag needed to come to the service desk After realizing my bag was not coming I was directed to a room in the back where I inquired about the location of the bag The airport staff then said oh you re the owner of the Crown Royal bag and began to giggle They informed that my bag fell and was ran over and some of my stuff have been destroyed with not even the smallest hint of remorse My bag was literally destroyed to the point all the clothes and shoes In it were ripped to shreds destroyed When I became angry the south west employee asked me what are you so mad about it s not like we are not going to cut you a check I explained to the worker that I am in a city I have never been to with absolutely nothing to wear and all my belongings destroyed The employee began to tell me how southwest is a million dollar company they have no problem cutting a check as if this was suppose to make me feel better The employee then told me it happens all the time due to southwest handling so much luggage on a daily basis and they just cut a check The employees asked me to go through my bag and damages and asked me to price the cost of each item The south west employee sat on the computer googled my items one by one while making comments like woah you really paid for that and arguing with me over the amount I paid for each item saying things like well they have it for cheaper at this store The worker also went as far to turn to his employee and say I don t even argue with these people After the employee calculated what he felt I deserved for my belongings he wrote a check for and told me I should just go to the mall buy new items The employee told me I can go to chase bank and cash the check the same day which was a lie I went to chase bank and they told me they could not cash check because southwest had to verify it and no one answered the phone I was not able to cash check

741, Southwest really flew the extra mile today in terms of demonstrating just how terrible they are at customer service After a hr delay in leaving the West Coast they informed passengers that they had informed the connecting flights to wait a bit so that passengers could make their connections We land in the Midwest and I rush to my connection only to find out that No one had bothered to inform this flight crew that there were delayed passengers rushing to catch this flight my plane was literally sitting right there on the other side of the glass and they refused to let me on because they had already counted the passengers the next connection was hours later but oh wait that was delayed another hrs too So even though the two flights that I needed to catch were more than hours delayed they couldn t hold this one for a few minutes And then when they gave me a ticket for the last flight of the day they put me on one of the last groups for seating and because Southwest doesn t assign seats then it just means you will have a horrible seat I pressed and they gave me seating after the first group Fast forward four hours later on a late Sunday evening after traveling all day and it looks like a small group of passengers DID get to board before everyone because they were from a connecting flight So apparently Southwest does not care at all if it s one or a few persons being royally screwed by every one of their actions All the while the staff who answered my questions responded curtly seemed annoyed and one manager simply stared at me and asked what I wanted in deadpan voice after the person at the desk explained the situation A friendly service reminder to never ever fly this airline that doesn t care the least bit for individual customer experiences

745, Rochester to Las Vegas via Baltimore and Salt Lake City The flight from Rochester to Baltimore was operated on a Boeing while the flight from Baltimore to Salt Lake City and onward to Las Vegas was operated on a Boeing We had some comedians as flight attendants on these flights The first two kind of struggled to get us to laugh The third however was absolutely hilarious I noticed several indirect advertisements for Southwest s new flights to Hawaii through joking we had just landed in Hawaii The flight from Rochester to Baltimore featured the usual beverage service and packet of pretzels as did the flight from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas For the flight from Baltimore to Salt Lake City which was much longer there were two beverage services and we were offered shortbread cookies or Fritos or both As usual inflight entertainment was available but only if you had a streaming device with you I don t know why but for some reason I felt like the flight attendants on the first two of these flights were a little less friendly than I ve experienced in the past on Southwest Not hostile but just kind of passive yet also a little impatient with passengers as they boarded like during previous flights I guess my biggest gripe is the food I know it s a low cost carrier and I know it s a domestic flight in the U S But somehow for a flight that lasts for something like five hours I feel like people really ought to be offered more than just a couple of packets of snacks Yes I am absolutely spoiled by Asian carriers which offer full hot meals on such flights

747, Ontario to Denver Take their no show policy seriously Ten hours travel my elderly mother appeared to have a stroke and was transported to a local emergency room Numerous tests were being done because of the concern for her wellbeing and the doctor was less than sure about what the cause was Being an only child I stayed with my mom during this process getting her to agree to treatment

have a cheery disposition because before I knew it another attendant was in my face telling me I need to listen to the attendants I was already in a seat and was lost as to what she was talking about

was told to leave the plane I was not loud nor drunk nor physically abusive I did not raise my voice nor did I cause a commotion And now I am told to leave the plane because person decided to take his

806, Las Vegas to Orlando via Nashville On August flight was over minutes late arriving in Las Vegas This caused the flight to leave Las Vegas over minutes late this jeopardizing our connection flight in Nashville The flight attendants then said they will hold the plane in Nashville until we arrive there However we paid for the early bird check in because Southwest doesn t assign seats for their passengers In order for you and your family members to sit together you have to purchase the early bird check in which assures you a place in line within the first people This does not work if your flight is delayed coming in and your connecting flight already boards everyone even the people who didn t pay for the early bird check in So you get screwed and lose your place in line which you paid for So when they boarded us onto flight and we tell the flight attendant that we paid for the early bird check in The flight attendant says well we waited minutes for your flight to get in How is that the passenger s fault that the flight go in late So they tell us to sit in the only available seats which are center seats not even in the same row Also to make matters worse the seats are sandwiched in between larger than normal sized people So I had to squeeze between large people and my husband got to sit next to a lbs man who was partially in his seat so much so that he had to lay his tray table down to lean on it for the entire flight Did the flight attendants care Of course not because they herd people like cattle on these aeroplanes they don t care if your flight is uncomfortable The flight lasted hour and minutes to Orlando When we got home I called Southwest Customer Service and the only thing they said they can do from their end is to refund us the each that we paid for the early bird check in They said to call their Customer Relations Department On I call Customer Relations and explain to the representative the situation and the terrible experience and she said she can only refund us each in travel vouchers towards another Southwest flight So this airline company takes your money gives you a terrible flight experience and only gives you each for your unsatisfactory experience due to their flights not keeping on schedule I told the representative if Southwest assigned seats in the first place it would not have been a problem because no one would have sat in someone else s seat We pay for the early bird boarding to get within the first people on a plane so parties can sit together Looking back in hindsight my husband and I should have walked off the plane and asked to be put on another plane where we would be able to board within the early bird boarding and not lose our place in line I doubt if I will ever book another trip with Southwest ,"[('Las',

later received a text that the flight was canceled Although it does text you new flights available the process makes you pay for the new flight so I didn t process but went to the counter at the gate There were over people in a line dealing with the same situation There were two ladies working the counter there were additional stations open that more employees could have been deployed to move the line faster I was in this line for hours Once it was my turn no greeting from the employee no apology and only one option was given for a new flight which was the following day with a layover making my direct flight into a much longer trip I asked if Southwest was offering any compensation to their customers for hotel accommodations and the answer was the weather in Milwaukee was going to get really bad and by the time the flight would get there the airport would be closed so no they don t compensate for weather That statement was false I live in Milwaukee and no rain or storms were in the

that anyone was doing all they could to help I understand a regional airline like Southwest doesn t have as many flights as the other airlines to try and help people but they could have shown empathy

done for The nightmare initially begun on the th of July when I was scheduled to depart from St Louis to arrive in Norfolk VA Arrive at the Southwest ticketing counter to learn my flight had been cancelled due to weather Once I learned this I asked the ticketing agent isn t it protocol for someone to call text or email me the customer to make them aware of the flight changes The reply I got was priceless Basically my question was ignored So now the ticketing agent begins to look in order to rebook my flight Now they book me a flight for the very next morning However this time I will have to fly from St Louis to Cleveland OH then to Chicago Illinois and then onto a Norfolk Of course I accept the reservation thinking all has been resolved and there would be no more issues So approximately hours later I arrive back in St Louis airport I board the first flight from St Louis thinking I m finally on my way to my destination and I would be good to go The plane lands arriving in Cleveland with the pilot coming on the speaker stating there s a weather delay and no one can get in or out of Chicago After sitting in Cleveland for almost four hours until finally being cleared for take off to continue the journey now to Chicago and then Norfolk Finally land in Chicago approximately three hours after my Southwest connection flight had already departed for Norfolk I immediately go to Southwest customer service counter to explain what I just went through First I m told all remaining flights are booked going to Norfolk I m also told that they can fly me to Baltimore Maryland the next day which would be the third day And I m also told when I get to Baltimore I would have to be on standby in order to try to get a flight to Norfolk Now my frustration is beginning to show I ask if I would be provided a hotel here in Chicago and I was told no So I get no hotel no later flight and absolutely nothing at all in order to make up for this inconvenience Not even a bag of peanuts or even a drink I always knew this was a suspect airline However take it from me Save your money and go United or Delta If you don t and something happens In my case weather Then your just throwing your money away I understand weather is not the airlines fault However it s how the customer service takes care of their customers during that inconvenience is what is being measured I m a customer who definitely learns from their mistakes In short no one should have to experience this especially in a strange unfamiliar city and then get told that the best they can do is have me sleep on the floor in the airport and then ride to another strange city to then be placed on standby for the final destination,"[('Absolutely', 'r'), ('ridiculous', 'a'), ('customer', 'n'),

through a rd party and not Southwest themselves despite using the Southwest official website to book After a minute conversation I was forced to leave the following day as there were no flights remaining that day unless I could get to the gate within minutes causing me to miss previously scheduled and paid for events that could not be made up or refunded I then call the hotel and try to cancel my room since I will not be staying there and they said that since I booked though Southwest Vacations they had to cancel the room and refund me Did not seem like an issue Fast forward to today I finally am back and get to speak with customer relations from Southwest Thinking that this should not be much of an issue as they had miscommunication on their end they could refund me for the nights stay that I would miss as they called and cancelled the night with the hotel and would be able to compensate me in some manor for the error of not contacting me to allow me to get on a different flight earlier that day that had availability and some possible compensation for the events that were missed During the conversation with the agent for Southwest she specifically said that They would take responibility for the error as Southwest Vacations is subcontracted though a rd party administrator Even though it bears the offical Southwest logo is accessed though their Official website they contract out that to another party but she still stated they would were taking take responsibility I think great we can get this taken care of to only have Southwest offer me a voucher to cover missed events a premium room on Saturday night in Las Vegas and a lost day of my vacation This is unacceptable as they themselves took responsibility for the error and still refused to at the very least refund me the money for the hotel room that was never used and some gesture for the error I can not believe that Southwest who allows their logo and namesake to be used to mislead loyal customers into using something that they promote on their website but then do not stand behind even though it holds their name is despicable I felt disrespected as a loyal customer to be offered for what was a loss of times that amount Southwest if you are going to license out your name to a separate company back them and have a system in place to contact clients or do not promote them on your official website to defraud your loyal customers ,"[('regretfully', 'r'), ('feel', 'v'), ('obligated', 'v'), ('report', 'v'), ('experience', 'n'), ('previous', 'a'), ('weekend', 'n'), ('regarding',

851, New Orleans to San Francisco via San Diego Where do I begin This is our first time flying Southwest since August of and to fully explain my frustration with their customer service I ll have to start with the story of them cancelling both of our flights and leaving us with no other option than for us to pay k each for tickets back home in order to catch our out of country flight the next day We are both wedding photographers and were leaving New Orleans to head to Baltimore for a wedding The morning of our flight about two hours prior we received a notification from Southwest Airlines that our flight was cancelled They provided us with alternative flight options which we selected and then put us on standby without communicating this with us Fast forward after a hour travel day we made it to Baltimore a little after midnight Keep in mind the direct flight is normally hours The morning of our returning flight from Baltimore to New Orleans we received yet another cancellation notification However this time the link to their flight change wasn t working no flights were available to select and the help call line to book another flight had a wait time of hours And so I waited because we didn t really have any other option And each time they picked up the call they disconnected us leaving us with literally zero alternative flight options or any way to get in touch with Southwest Airlines This charade continued on until pm in the afternoon no contact from southwest no alternative flights they straight up cancelled our flights and gave us nothing in return Because we were leaving the country the next day we had no other choice than to pay k for a ticket out of Baltimore Southwest Airlines finally got in touch with us a few days later not acknowledging any lack in their system pretending as though the day of our cancelled departure never happened They offered us a voucher for our trouble What A Joke Now a year later in hopes that southwest has their stuff together we ve boarded our plane from New Orleans only for them to tell us an engine failed to stay on They asked us to switch planes no biggie This stuff happens Two hours later and we re finally boarding the next plane We miss our connecting flight in San Diego due to their delay and end up waiting another two hours for our next flight They call us to the front desk to adjust our tickets A group what s up yes we were quick we were prepared and they had us boarding at the back of the plane I kid you not They not only delayed us by hours but they didn t even have the courtesy of taking care of us by allowing us to board in our original position or even during pre boarding Come on southwest we were loyal before you repeatedly screwed us over So while Southwest is great with their checked bags and while it s awesome that you can be flexible with them remember there s a massive chance they ll cancel your flight and leave you having to spend a couple grand on a new flight and then pretend that never happened ,"[('New', 'n'), ('Orleans', 'n'), ('San', 'n'), ('Francisco', 'n'), ('via', None), ('San', 'n'), ('Diego', 'n'), ('begin', 'v'), ('first', 'a'), ('time', 'n'),

883, Good afternoon I wanted to take a minute to say thank you and share with you why you have converted me from another airline for life My wife s Grandmother was in her last days and hours of her life the last week of March this year My wife and I had planned on traveling to see her and had a ticket purchased already for my wife and one of my daughters but we needed it changed and needed to get me and my other daughter a flight For my work I travel quite frequently from Nashville to Dallas among other places on another airline Because of my status I like them to continue to build points with them I called them first to book myself and my daughter a flight to Phoenix They were of no assistance would not budge on the price for an emergency and would still charge me a large amount to move my points I hung up My wife then called Southwest Not only did they get us booked last minute they adjusted the pricing for an emergency and helped us the whole way thru it moving our points around etc Even when we got to the airport they bumped us to an even earlier flight to get us there as quickly as possible What a blessing it was to fly with you If we would have gone with the other airline or had we not been bumped up to an earlier flight we would not have made it in time to see her grandmother before she passed We arrived within less than hours of her passing What you do for people every day may seem routine but for us it was a life changing moment Having my wife be there before her grandmother passed means more to me than I can possibly express to you As a result I have decided to switch to Southwest for all of my work and personal trips going forward even though I do not have status with you Sometimes I fly out of Knoxville where you do not service but other than that I will forever use you now Thank you for making such a hard time for my family just a little easier ,"[('Good', 'a'), ('afternoon', 'n'), ('wanted', 'v'), ('take', 'v'), ('minute', 'n'), ('say',

891, Austin to Houston This trip which ended in Alabama was the most horrible experience I ve had in all the years of traveling first the company that I went to work for chose the least expensive way to get me to the location When I boarded the plane I was wearing a leather jacket that was owned by my stepfather who had passed away it was handed down to me for years I had admired this jacket and I decided to take it with me for good luck at my sales event however it was rather bulky so when I got on the plane they were full and the airline stewardess asked if I would put the jacket in the above head storage I ve heard horror stories of arguing with a flight attendant and have seen too many movies so I complied and put it in the overhead bin However I did not realize of the seating arrangements which is open seating when you get on the plane so the only seats that were available were the center seats which left me at a disadvantage where I couldn t see the overhead bin that my jacket was it So when we landed I had to wait for everyone to move in order to get out of my seat and by the time I got to the bin where my jacket was to be it was gone I of course did not get upset because again did not want to be escorted off the plane so I asked as I got off about my jacket they said they would check on it once I get off I waited about minutes or so no one came out finally someone came out and said they could not find my jacket and that I would have to report it online because they had no one there to take the report which I thought was odd as a customer service gesture When I finally spoke to them they told me that I need to report it online after I done so all I heard from them is we haven t found it we haven t found it to this day I have not heard from them again

920, I just wanted to share my recent experience with Southwest so that people can make informed decisions and know what they are getting themselves into when they book with them I did not have a good experience with Southwest Airlines I received an email from Southwest on Wednesday night indicating that my Thursday morning flight back from Boston to Denver had been cancelled due to weather I had heard from my brother in law who used to fly Southwest frequently that they had a very strict weather cancellation policy so out of curiosity I went to check if all flights into Denver were cancelled or if Southwest was just falling back on their strict weather cancellation policy I found that both JetBlue and Spirit flights were still scheduled to arrive in Denver on time which would lead me to believe that although Denver airport conditions may not have been ideal they were safe enough for commercial airlines to fly in Denver International Airport was even indicating that they had of their runways open I called the number Southwest included in their flight cancellation email to reschedule my flight After waiting on hold for about hours I was disconnected so I called them back immediately only to wait on hold for more hours Once I was finally able to get through to a customer service representative to reschedule my flight the representative told me that the absolute soonest flight they could get me on was not until Sunday days later My husband and I had plans to go up to the mountains for the weekend and flying back into Denver on Sunday would have caused us to miss our entire trip So I called AMEX Travel as I had booked through them initially and they were able to get me on a United flight leaving Saturday one day earlier than the Southwest flight At this point I was really wishing I would have booked with JetBlue or Spirit as now I would be stuck in Boston an additional days that I had not planned for This means more nights in a hotel more days of having to purchase food and more days of missing work If this wasn t inconvenient enough my husband and I were also not going to be able to make our trip to the mountains which we had already planned Just for fun I added up all the costs that stemmed from Southwest cancelling my flight Hotel per night x nights prices had gone up over the weekend due to the St Patrick s Day holiday Food about meal x meals Missed days of work hr x hrs hr workdays Total amount lost due to Southwest cancelling my flight because of their strict weather policy this is not including the money that was already spent on our trip to the mountains that we were not able to take I don t know many people who can afford to just lose out on that amount of money Southwest did end up refunding my cancelled flight which naturally they should considering they cancelled it In addition when I called in to see if they could offer any other kind of compensation they offered me a Southwest flight voucher They indicated that because the flight was cancelled due to weather the cancellation was out of their control and is not their fault I beg to differ JetBlue and Spirit did not cancel their flights so clearly the cancellation was due to some policy Southwest has that JetBlue and Spirit do not ,"[('wanted', 'v'), ('share', 'n'), ('recent', 'a'), ('experience', 'n'), ('Southwest', 'n'), ('people', 'n'), ('make', 'v'),

922, I had a change of last name that I e mailed well back in Jan Upon requesting how to get my last name change I was not informed that I should also include any upcoming flight reservation numbers That being said only my Rapid Rewards profile was updated on the site nothing else I didn t know what to make of this by the time I went to fly out I was allowed to fly with my old married last name with no issues but was almost left to not be allowed to get on the plane from Austin because my ID didn t match my boarding pass name This caused me to nearly miss my flight and I rushed to the gate losing items I ve never in my life lost so many items in my life especially not all at once I was incredibly flustered I lost items at Austin one on a plane going to Nashville then at the Nashville Airport before boarding my flight back to Chicago The incorrect last name was Baker instead of Anderson I called to their Customer Service headquarters to where the best they could do was offer me a voucher of That s not even enough for a free flight round trip to anywhere They seriously don t care about their customers because aside from using this voucher I will no longer be using their flight services again I didn t even get a promised drink from Nashville into Chicago I also landed without a jacket because this was one of my lost items and ended up freezing I ve reported my lost items twice TWICE Because after you call in to report a claim of a lost item they insist that you fill out a document of theirs to be submitted via e mail on top of it This company makes all sorts of excuses as to why they won t do anything further They say that they had no idea I had an upcoming flight based on my RR I had no idea they even needed it So they can t point blame on me What happened to the Customer s always right attitude I ll be taking my business elsewhere and I recommend everyone else does the same I get that they are not responsible for lost items however I would not have lost any of those items if I hadn t been flustered to missing my plane to begin with so yes it is their fault when I ve never lost anything at airports in my life I m very disappointed in this airline

wheelchairs weren t available yet Fortunately the other people were able to walk off the aircraft without a problem I advised the stewardess of my restrictions and stated I would wait Everyone had gotten off and the stewardess asked me to walk off I again told her I could not They cleaned the plane a bit and again told me I needed to get off I did not fight it and advised them I could not lift my bag and they carried it off for me and had me stand in pain in the alleyway and wait with the entire crew She then said I needed to go so I slowly started walking and walked most the alley way where I was then greeted with a wheelchair The attendant then took off hitting the bump off the gate I told him I just had surgery but clearly he was in a hurry This is absolutely unacceptable I legitimately needed help and had arranged for assistance on advance with documentation stating my restrictions If there weren t any wheelchairs available I should not have been forced to walk in pain

949, Hartford to Tampa The fact that we were significantly delayed tonight by hr min isn t even the motivation behind this review It s not even the constant WiFi problems we experience every single

emailed them explaining that the reason I was short was because I was forced to fly Delta a few times due to Southwest cancelling or delaying the flights in question It was such a light hearted plea
